Doors and locks are fundamental components of your vehicle, providing access to the cabin and ensuring security. Keeping them in good working order is essential for safety and peace of mind.

## Importance of Door and Lock Maintenance
Well-maintained doors and locks not only secure your vehicle against theft but also ensure quick and safe entry and exit in emergencies.

## Maintaining Car Doors

### Inspection and Lubrication

- **Hinges and Latches**: Regularly inspect hinges and latches for signs of wear. Apply lubricant to keep them functioning smoothly.
- **Seals and Weatherstripping**: Check for damage or wear to ensure the cabin is insulated from noise, water, and wind. More on [Car Care](/car-care/routine-maintenance).

### Common Issues

- **Sticking or Jammed Doors**: Can be caused by misaligned latches, worn hinges, or damaged seals.
- **Rattling Noise**: Often indicates loose components within the door panel.

## Lock Maintenance

### Regular Checks

- **Manual Locks**: Ensure they turn smoothly without sticking.
- **Power Locks**: Test for responsive operation and listen for any unusual noises.

### Addressing Problems

- **Sticking Locks**: Lubricate with graphite powder or silicone-based lubricant.
- **Faulty Power Locks**: May require professional inspection to diagnose electrical or mechanical issues.

## Safety and Security Measures
Always lock your doors while driving to prevent unauthorized entry and ensure doors don't accidentally open.

### Emergency Exit

<Warning>
Ensure all passengers can easily open doors from the inside. Regularly check child safety locks if your vehicle is equipped with them.
</Warning>

## Seasonal Considerations

- **Winter**: Prevent freezing locks by using a lock de-icer or a silicone-based lubricant.
- **Summer**: Protect seals from drying out and cracking with rubber protectants.
