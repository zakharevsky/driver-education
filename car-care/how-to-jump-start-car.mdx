## Understanding the Mechanics of Jump-Starting a Car

<Info>
Jump-starting a car involves **using another power source to revive a dead battery**. It's essentially a temporary connection to another car or external power source, allowing the dead battery to draw enough current to start the engine. Once the engine is running, the car's alternator begins recharging the dead battery.
