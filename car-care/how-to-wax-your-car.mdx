    1. **Wax Under Cover**: To prevent immediate drying and uneven application, wax your car in a shaded area.
    2. **Use a Random Orbital Buffer**: This tool ensures an even application and reduces the risk of paint damage.
    3. **Soft Brush for Gaps**: Clean any excess wax from moldings and crevices with a soft brush.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Choosing the Right Wax">
  When selecting the right wax for your car, consider the paint color and type:

  - **For Dark-Colored Cars**: Carnauba-based waxes enhance depth and richness.
  - **For Light-Colored Cars**: Polymer-based sealants work best for brighter and cleaner appearance.
  - **For Metallic Paints**: Opt for waxes specifically designed for metallic finishes.
  - **Older Cars**: Waxes with cleaning agents help rejuvenate older paint.
  - **New Cars**: A pure wax, free from cleaning agents, maintains the new car shine.

  Tip: Always test the wax on a small area first to ensure compatibility with your car’s paint.

  <Accordion title="Waxing Frequency">
  The frequency of waxing your car varies depending on climate and usage:

  - **Mild Climates**: Wax every 3-4 months.
  - **Harsh Climates**: In areas with intense sun, snow, or sea air, wax every 2-3 months.
  - **Frequent Usage**: If you drive daily, especially on highways or in urban areas, consider waxing every 2 months.
  - **Occasional Usage**: For cars used less often, waxing twice a year is sufficient.
