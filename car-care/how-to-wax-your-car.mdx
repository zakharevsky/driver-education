  <Accordion title="Choosing the Right Wax">
  When selecting the right wax for your car, consider the paint color and type:

  - **For Dark-Colored Cars**: Carnauba-based waxes enhance depth and richness.
  - **For Light-Colored Cars**: Polymer-based sealants work best for brighter and cleaner appearance.
  - **For Metallic Paints**: Opt for waxes specifically designed for metallic finishes.
  - **Older Cars**: Waxes with cleaning agents help rejuvenate older paint.
  - **New Cars**: A pure wax, free from cleaning agents, maintains the new car shine.

  Tip: Always test the wax on a small area first to ensure compatibility with your car’s paint.
