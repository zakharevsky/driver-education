Tires are the foundation of your driving experience. They are the only part of your vehicle that touches the road, making their maintenance not just a matter of performance, but of safety.

## Importance of Tire Maintenance

<Note>
Proper tire maintenance is critical for the safety, handling, and fuel efficiency of your vehicle. Regular checks can prevent accidents, improve your car's responsiveness, and even save you money on fuel and tire replacements.
</Note>

## Checking Air Pressure

<Tip title="Regular Air Pressure Checks">
Maintaining the correct air pressure in your tires is essential for efficient handling, braking, and fuel consumption. Check your tire pressure monthly and before long trips or carrying extra load.
</Tip>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find the Recommended Pressure">
    Check your vehicle’s manual or the sticker on the driver’s side door for the recommended tire pressure.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use a Tire Pressure Gauge">
    Remove the cap from the tire’s valve stem and press the tire gauge firmly onto it. Compare the reading with the recommended pressure.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adjust Accordingly">
    Inflate or deflate your tires to match the recommended pressure.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Inspecting Tread Depth

<Warning>
Low tire tread depth can reduce traction, especially in wet conditions, increasing the risk of accidents. Monitor your tire treads to ensure they are within safe limits.
</Warning>

### How to Check Tread Depth

1. **Use a Tread Depth Gauge**: This tool provides the most accurate measurement.
2. **The Penny Test**: Insert a penny into the tread groove with Lincoln's head upside down. If you can see all of Lincoln's head, it's time to replace your tire.
3. **Tread Wear Indicators**: Modern tires have built-in tread wear indicators. When these bars are flush with the tread, it’s time for new tires.

## Overall Tire Condition

<Info>
Regularly inspect your tires for any signs of damage such as cuts, cracks, bulges, or objects embedded in the tread. Address any issues immediately to avoid further damage.
</Info>

## Tire Rotation and Balancing

<Tip title="Extend Tire Life">
Rotating and balancing your tires every 5,000 to 8,000 miles can prevent uneven wear and extend the life of your tires.
</Tip>

## When to Replace Tires

<Warning>
Replace your tires if the tread depth is below 1/16 of an inch, if there are signs of severe damage, or if they are more than six years old, regardless of visual condition.
</Warning>
