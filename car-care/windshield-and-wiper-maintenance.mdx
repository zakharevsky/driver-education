Ensuring a clear view through your windshield is crucial for safe driving. The windshield and wipers work together to provide visibility and protect you from the elements. Regular maintenance of these components is key.

## Windshield Maintenance

A clear, intact windshield is vital for visibility and as a safety barrier. It's important to regularly check for any chips, cracks, or other damage.

### Tips for Windshield Care

- **Regular Cleaning**: Use a glass cleaner and a microfiber cloth to keep the windshield clear.
- **Chip Repair**: Address any chips promptly to prevent them from turning into larger cracks.
- **Avoid Extreme Temperature Changes**: Sudden changes in temperature can worsen existing cracks.
