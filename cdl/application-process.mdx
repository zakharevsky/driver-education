For all CDL types, basic requirements are federally set, but states may add more. For example, **21 years old is mandatory for interstate driving**, but many states allow 18-year-olds to drive intrastate. 

When applying, provide evidence of your social security number, identity, and residency. The accepted documents vary by state, so check your state's DMV website or CDL manual for specifics. 

**Medical Fitness for Driving:** Beyond the vision exam, you'll need to submit the Medical Examination Report Form (MCSA-5875) and the Medical Examiner's Certificate Form (MCSA-5876). After 2023, these forms are mandatory for all commercial drivers, regardless of intrastate or interstate travel.
