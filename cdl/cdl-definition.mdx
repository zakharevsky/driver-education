`CDL` stands for **Commercial Driver’s License**. This special license is a must-have for anyone planning to operate large or heavy vehicles, or vehicles carrying hazardous materials for commercial purposes in the U.S. 

If you're eyeing a career that involves driving commercial motor vehicles (CMVs), you'll likely need a CDL. Plus, depending on the vehicle type—like those with air brakes, tank trucks, hazardous materials, or passenger vehicles—you'll need specific [<code>endorsements</code>](/cdl-types/endorsements/introduction) like [Air Brakes](/cdl-types/endorsements/air-brakes), [Hazardous Materials (Hazmat)](/cdl-types/endorsements/hazmat), [Tankers](cdl-types/endorsements/tanker), or [Passenger Vehicles](/cdl-types/endorsements/passenger). 

To earn these endorsements, be prepared to pass some [written tests](/essentials/written-tests/overview) and possibly [skills tests](essentials/skills-test), depending on the endorsement. For high-stakes stuff like Hazmat, you’ll also need to be fingerprinted and pass a TSA security threat assessment.

## What's a Commercial Learner's Permit (CLP)?
A `CLP` or <code>CDL Permit</code> is your first stepping stone towards a CDL. It's essential for practicing with a commercial motor vehicle (CMV). You'll get your CLP after acing the knowledge tests for your desired CMV class and endorsements. [Learn more about the CDL Permit here](/cdl-types/cdl-permit).

### The Role of a CLP
A CLP lets you legally practice driving a CMV—but there's a catch. You must be accompanied by someone who holds a valid CDL with the right endorsements for the vehicle you're driving. Think of it as your learning period, where you'll need at least 14 days of practice with a licensed driver before you can take the skills test.
