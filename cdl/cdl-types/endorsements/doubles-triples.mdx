## Sample Test Questions for the Doubles/Triples Endorsement

Prepare for your endorsement test with these sample questions:

1. **In a set of triples, where should the heaviest trailer be?**
   The heaviest trailer should be the closest to the power unit to maintain stability.

2. **Why should you never disconnect the pintle hook with the dolly still under the rear trailer?**
   Disconnecting the pintle hook without removing the dolly can lead to a loss of control or cause the dolly to flip up, potentially causing injury or damage.

3. **What is it called when the rear wheels follow a different path than the front wheels when a vehicle goes around a corner?**
   This is known as 'off-tracking' or 'cheating', and it is more pronounced with longer vehicles or those pulling trailers.
