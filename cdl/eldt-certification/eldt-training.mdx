- Obtaining a [Class A](/cdl-types/class-a-cdl) or [Class B](/cdl-types/class-b-cdl) Commercial Driver's License (CDL) for the first time.
- Upgrading from a Class B CDL to a Class A CDL.
- Seeking a [school bus (S)](/cdl-types/endorsements/school-bus), [passenger (P)](/cdl-types/endorsements/passenger), or [hazardous materials (H)](/cdl-types/endorsements/hazmat) endorsement for the first time.
