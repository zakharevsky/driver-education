<Tip>Starting on February 7, 2022, the CDL licensing process changed dramatically. But what exactly changed and how does it affect you?</Tip>

## What has changed for the applicants?

**From February 7, 2022, all entry-level applicants are now required to complete an approved CDL training program that prepares them for the CLP and CDL knowledge tests.** The new Training Provider Registry (TPR) lists all CDL training providers approved by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA). Applicants can no longer self-study and take their CDL knowledge tests as soon as they feel ready. Instead, they must complete a CDL training program from an FMCSA-approved theory training provider and submit their training completion certificate to the TPR. The training provider will submit the training completion certificate to the TPR, which will allow the applicant to take the official knowledge tests from the DMV or a DMV-approved third-party testing organization. Similarly, applicants must complete a behind-the-wheel training program from an FMCSA-approved behind-the-wheel training provider before being allowed to take the official skills tests.


<Info>**What is the Training Provider Registry (TPR)?** The TPR is a database maintained by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) that lists the names of all training providers approved by FMCSA. Starting on February 7, 2022, the TPR is your primary source for finding an approved training provider when you're seeking to obtain a CDL or a Hazardous Materials (H), Passenger (P), or School Bus (S) endorsement. [Learn more about the TPR](https://tpr.fmcsa.dot.gov/).</Info>

## How does this change affect me?

It affects you if you are:

1. A first-time (entry-level) applicant seeking a new Class A or Class B Commercial Driver’s License (CDL);
2. An applicant upgrading an existing Class B CDL to a Class A CDL;
3. An applicant seeking a first-time school bus (S), passenger (P), or hazardous materials (H) endorsement.

## Is Driving-Tests.org an approved provider?

Yes. Driving-Tests.org is an approved theory training provider for all 50 states and Washington, DC. It is listed on the Training Provider Registry (TPR). After completing our CDL Premium program for your state and reaching a Passing Probability of 80% or better, we’ll submit your training completion certificate to the TPR. We will electronically notify the Training Provider Registry that you’re qualified to take the official CDL knowledge test. Once your training completion certificate has been successfully submitted, you can head to your nearest DMV office or DMV-approved third-party testing organization and take the test.

You can locate Driving-Tests.org in the [Training Provider Registry](https://tpr.fmcsa.dot.gov/) by searching for "Driving-Tests" and switching to the "Online" tab.

## How/when will you submit my certificate to TPR?

For our CDL Premium customers, we'll submit your training completion certificate to the TPR automatically as soon as you finish the program and obtain a minimum Passing Probability of 80%. Ensure you have provided your name, date of birth, license number, and a few more details on [your Settings page](https://driving-tests.org/settings/). This information is required before we can submit your certificate to the TPR. We’ll send you an email confirmation, and you’ll also be able to see it on [this page](https://driving-tests.org/pass-probability/cdl/).

## Is there any additional cost for submitting my certificate to TPR?

No, there is no additional cost involved. You can submit your training completion certificate to the TPR electronically through our website after completing our program and obtaining a minimum Passing Probability of 80%.
