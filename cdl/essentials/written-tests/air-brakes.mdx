## Key Components of the System

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Understanding the Systems">
    Air brake systems, essential for commercial vehicles, consist of several components. Key parts include the compressor, reservoirs, valves, and brake chambers, each playing a crucial role in the system's functionality.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Functionality">
    When the brake pedal is pressed, air from the compressor travels to the brake chambers. This air pressure clamps the brake pads onto the brake drum, slowing or stopping the vehicle.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
