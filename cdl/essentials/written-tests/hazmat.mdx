## What is HazMat?
**Hazardous materials, often abbreviated as “hazmat,” are products that pose a risk to health, safety, or property during transportation.** Some examples are explosives, flammable liquids, and radioactive materials. Strict federal and state regulations govern whether or how various hazardous materials can be transported by road. Most (but not all) types and quantities of hazardous materials can be transported only in a motor vehicle with placards (diamond-shaped signs) attached to identify the materials and their risks.

An endorsement is an additional qualification that can be added to your Commercial Driver’s License (CDL) to allow you to drive certain types of vehicles or carry passengers or certain types of cargo.
