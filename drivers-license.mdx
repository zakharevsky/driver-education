#### Frequently Missed Questions
Be cautious with questions framed negatively or with words like "except" and "not." These can be tricky and are designed to ensure you understand what's being asked fully. It's easy to miss the details in these questions, so take your time and read each one carefully.
<Warning>Pay extra attention to questions about blood alcohol levels, right-of-way rules, and road sign meanings—areas where mistakes are often made.</Warning>

#### What to Do If You Fail
It's not the end of the road. Review the areas where you struggled, and when you feel ready, you can typically retake the exam. Check with your local DMV for specific retake policies.

## 3. Road Test

### Common mistakes
**Nervousness** can lead to errors like not checking mirrors, incorrect signaling, or inadequate speed control. Practice these to avoid typical slip-ups.

### Change of Address Procedures
Moved recently? Update your address with the DMV to ensure you receive all communication. This is often required by law within a certain timeframe after moving.

### Dealing with Traffic Violations
If you've received a citation, handle it promptly. Unaddressed violations can spiral into bigger issues, like suspended licenses.

### Reinstatement after Suspension
Should your license be suspended, follow the state's protocol for reinstatement, which may include fees, courses, or a waiting period.
