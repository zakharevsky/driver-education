<Tip>**Nowadays, the knowledge exam is often conducted on a computer.** This allows for a more interactive and dynamic testing experience. Results are typically available immediately after completion, streamlining the process and getting you one step closer to the road.</Tip>
### Understanding Test Format
The knowledge exam typically consists of multiple-choice questions. Familiarize yourself with the format beforehand to ensure no surprises on test day. This could include understanding the number of questions, passing score, and time limits.
### How to Prepare
Your best allies are the official driver's manual and online practice tests. They cover all possible topics, and repetition is key. Check out this [Driver's Knowledge Test Guide](/start-driving/knowledge-test) for more information.

#### Frequently Missed Questions
<Warning>Pay extra attention to questions about blood alcohol levels, right-of-way rules, and road sign meanings—areas where mistakes are often made.</Warning>

#### What to Do If You Fail
It's not the end of the road. Review the areas where you struggled, and when you feel ready, you can typically retake the exam. Check with your local DMV for specific retake policies.

## 3. Road Test
Before taking the road test, ensure you've clocked sufficient practice hours, ideally in various driving conditions. It's the real-world application of what you've studied. Check out our [Driving Basics](/start-driving/overview) section to learn more about the essentials of safe driving. 

### Vehicle Requirements
The car you use for the test should be roadworthy: all signals, lights, and brakes must be in working order. Also, make sure you have valid registration and insurance for the vehicle.

### Common mistakes
Nervousness can lead to errors like not checking mirrors, incorrect signaling, or inadequate speed control. Practice these to avoid typical slip-ups.

### What to Do If You Fail
Take it as a learning experience. Review the examiner’s feedback, practice accordingly, and reschedule the test when you feel confident in your improvements.

## 4. On the Road
Congratulations on earning your license! It’s more than just a piece of plastic—it’s your ticket to the open road. Remember, real-world driving is an ongoing learning experience. Keep the New Driver's Toolkit in your glove compartment—it's packed with tips on handling emergency situations, keeping your ride purring, and making wise insurance choices.

### New Driver's Toolkit [PDF]
Resources for emergency situations, car maintenance, and best insurance practices.

### Practical Driving Tps
Practice makes perfect. Stay observant, keep a safe following distance, and always signal your intentions. It's the small habits that make a big difference in safety.

### Understanding Road Signs and Rules
Keep refreshing your knowledge of road signs and rules. They’re not just suggestions—they’re the law.

### Safe Driving Practices
Drive defensively, not aggressively. Keep distractions to a minimum, and never underestimate the importance of a good night’s sleep before driving.

### Advanced Driving Courses
To polish your driving skills, consider taking an advanced driving course. It can improve your techniques and may even lower your insurance rates.

## 5. Maintaining Your License
Keeping your driver's license valid is like running a marathon—pacing and attention to detail go a long way. Stay on top of renewal deadlines; it's easier than scrambling to fix an expired license.

### Renewal Process
Check your license for the expiration date and renew before it arrives. Most states allow online renewals, saving you a trip to the DMV.

### Change of Address Procedures
Moved recently? Update your address with the DMV to ensure you receive all communication. This is often required by law within a certain timeframe after moving.

### Dealing with Traffic Violations
If you've received a citation, handle it promptly. Unaddressed violations can spiral into bigger issues, like suspended licenses.

### License Reinstatement after Suspension
Should your license be suspended, follow the state's protocol for reinstatement, which may include fees, courses, or a waiting period.
