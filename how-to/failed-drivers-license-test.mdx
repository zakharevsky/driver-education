  <Accordion title="Understanding the Cause">
    Identifying the cause of failure is crucial. High anxiety levels can significantly affect your performance in both the written and road tests. On the flip side, if your preparation was lacking, it's essential to acknowledge this and commit to better readiness next time. Seek feedback from your examiner to pinpoint specific areas for improvement and inquire about the waiting period for a retest, as this varies by state and test type.

  <Accordion title="1. The Written Exam">
    The written exam often comprises 20 questions, meaning missing more than five can result in failure. Surprisingly, **35% of candidates fail on their first try**. If possible, find out which questions you got wrong to focus your studies, but remember, the exact questions likely won't repeat. Thus, a comprehensive review of the driving manual and taking multiple [online practice tests](https://driving-tests.org/beginner-drivers/free-permit-practice-tests-online-there-can-never-be-too-much-practice/) is advisable. Practice tests are a valuable tool for understanding the material and improving your chances of passing.

  <Accordion title="2. The Driving Exam">
    The road test can be daunting, with many failing due to nerves or minor mistakes. Feedback from your examiner is invaluable for identifying specific areas of concern. Some areas may require skills like parallel parking, highlighting the variability in test difficulty. **Practical experience** is key; consider practicing with a skilled driver who can provide honest feedback or enlisting a driving school's help to refine your skills and correct bad habits.
