Installing a new license plate is a quick task that every driver needs to know how to do. With a one simple tool, you will be able to remove your vehicle’s old license plate and install a new one in only a few minutes. Use these directions to install a new car tag.

## 6 Steps to Install a License Plate by Yourself

1. Begin by gathering your [tools and supplies](https://driving-tests.org/beginner-drivers/5-tools-every-driver-should-own/). You will need a Phillips or a flathead screwdriver, your new car tag, and the proper screws. If your vehicle is brand new, the screws for the license place holder may be located in the glove compartment or console.
    
2. Remove the old tag. Using the appropriate screw driver, remove the screws that are holding the current tag in place by turning them in a counterclockwise manner. Place the screws in a safe place while you remove the old tag. Remove the old tag and set it aside.
    
3. Align the new tag so that the predrilled holes match the appropriate holes on the bumper of your vehicle.
    
4. Attach the new tag using the screws you previously removed. Turn the screws in a clockwise manner. Make sure that the tag is secure but do not over tighten the bolts.
