Nothing is more annoying than pressing the lever to clean your windshield only to hear an empty wine and the sound of [your wipers](https://driving-tests.org/beginner-drivers/how-to-drive-in-rain/) scrape across your windshield. Fortunately, refilling your vehicle’s windshield wiper fluid is super simple. Follow these quick steps to have a clean windshield in no time.

## 8 Quick Steps to Refill Windshield Fluid

1. Pick up a jug of windshield wiper fluid at your local auto parts store, big box store, or even a gas station. They can usually be purchased for around three dollars.
    
2. Check your owner’s manual for any specific instruction or suggestions regarding refilling your vehicle’s windshield wiper fluid. Also look for instructions on locating the windshield wiper fluid container.
    
3. Pop the hood of your car and securely prop it open.
    
4. Locate your vehicle’s windshield wiper fluid container. Almost every model features a large, brightly colored plastic cap with an image of a windshield engraved on it.

5. Take off the lid and place it in a safe place.
    
6. Open the jug of windshield wiper fluid. Using a funnel, pour the fluid into the container until it reaches the fill line. If you do not see a fill line, leave a couple of inches of space at the top of the container.

Some types of windshield wiper fluid contain components that repel water or help to clean bug residue. It’s a good idea to keep a couple of jugs handy in your garage.
