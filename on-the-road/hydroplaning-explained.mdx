## What is Hydroplaning?

Hydroplaning, also known as aquaplaning, occurs when a layer of water builds up between the tires of a vehicle and the road surface, leading to a loss of traction. This prevents the vehicle from responding to control inputs such as steering, braking, or accelerating.

## Preventing Hydroplaning
Remember: hydroplaning can happen in an instant.

### 1. Reduce Speed
According to road safety experts, hydroplaning is most likely at speeds above 35 mph. It's recommended to slow down as soon as rain starts. Driving 5-10 mph below the speed limit, especially in heavy rain or windy conditions, can significantly reduce the risk.

### 2. Tire Maintenance
Regular tire rotation and balancing, every 7-10,000 miles, is essential. High-quality tires designed for wet conditions can also be a significant deterrent against hydroplaning. For more, see [Tire Maintenance](/car-care/tire-maintenance).

### 3. Avoid Cruise Control in the Rain
Using cruise control in the rain can delay response time in a hydroplaning situation. It's safer to have full manual control during wet conditions.

### 4. Watch for Standing Water
Puddles and standing water are high-risk areas for hydroplaning. It's best to avoid them or drive very slowly through them if unavoidable.

## Recovering from Hydroplaning

### 1. Stay Calm and Avoid Braking
If you start to hydroplane, gently lift your foot off the accelerator. Avoid using the brakes, as this can cause the vehicle to skid.

### 2. Steer Gently
Steer in the direction your vehicle is hydroplaning. This helps your tires realign and regain traction.

### 3. Wait for Tires to Regain Traction
You'll feel when your tires reconnect with the road. Then, you can gently steer back on course.

### 4. Take Time to Recover
If you need to, pull over safely to recover from the stressful experience.

Remember, the key to handling hydroplaning is to stay calm, make gentle adjustments, and prioritize preventive measures like proper tire maintenance and cautious driving in wet conditions. Learn more about [Safe Driving Tips](/drive-better/safety-tips).
