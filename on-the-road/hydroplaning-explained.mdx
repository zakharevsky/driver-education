## What is Hydroplaning?
Hydroplaning, also known as aquaplaning, occurs when **a vehicle's tires lose contact with the road surface, skimming over a layer of water**. This results in a significant reduction in traction, limiting the driver's ability to steer or brake effectively. Hydroplaning typically happens during heavy rain when water accumulates faster than tires can disperse it, influenced by factors like speed and tire condition.

## Tire Design and Maintenance: Key to Preventing Hydroplaning

**Tire tread design** plays a crucial role in preventing hydroplaning. Tires with deep grooves and sipes efficiently channel water away from the contact patch, enhancing wet road traction. Regular tire inspections are essential for maintaining optimal performance. Ensure tires are properly inflated and have adequate tread depth, as worn tires increase hydroplaning risks. Incorporating these practices can significantly improve driving safety in wet conditions.


## Comprehensive Safety Tips for Preventing Hydroplaning
Remember: hydroplaning can happen in an instant.


### Reduce Speed
According to road safety experts, hydroplaning is most likely at speeds above 35 mph. It's recommended to slow down as soon as rain starts. Driving 5-10 mph below the speed limit, especially in heavy rain or windy conditions, can significantly reduce the risk.

### Follow in Tracks 
Where safe, drive in the tire tracks left by vehicles ahead, as they've already moved some water away from the road surface.

### Regular Tire Checks
Regular tire rotation and balancing, every 7-10,000 miles, is essential. Ensure tires are properly inflated and have sufficient tread depth to effectively channel water. High-quality tires designed for wet conditions can also be a significant deterrent against hydroplaning. For more, see [Tire Maintenance](/car-care/tire-maintenance).

### Use Headlight
Improve visibility for yourself and others during rain.

### Avoid Cruise Control in the Rain
Using cruise control in the rain can delay response time in a hydroplaning situation. It's safer to have full manual control during wet conditions.

### Smooth Driving 
Avoid sudden turns, stops, or accelerations which can cause loss of traction.

### Watch for Standing Water
Avoid puddles. Puddles and standing water are high-risk areas for hydroplaning. It's best to avoid them or drive very slowly through them if unavoidable to minimize water buildup under tires.

### Stay Alert 
Be more attentive to road conditions and signs of hydroplaning, like light steering or spinning wheels.

## How to Recover from Hydroplaning

<Steps>

<Step title="Stay Calm">
Avoid panic to maintain control over the situation.
</Step>

<Step title="Ease off the Gas">
Gradually reduce speed without hitting the brakes harshly. Gently lift your foot off the accelerator. 
</Step>

<Step title="Steer Gently">
Direct your vehicle towards where you want to go using minimal steering input to maintain stability. This helps your tires realign and regain traction.
</Step>

<Step title="Avoid Sudden Movements">
Sudden braking or sharp steering can lead to a loss of control and can cause the vehicle to skid, increasing the risk of an accident. 
</Step>

<Step title="Wait for Traction">
Allow the vehicle to naturally slow down and regain traction with the road surface for safe recovery from hydroplaning. You'll feel when your tires reconnect with the road. Then, you can gently steer back on course.
</Step>

<Step title="Take Time to Recover">
If you need to, pull over safely to recover from the stressful experience.
</Step>

</Steps>

## Real-World Scenarios of Hydroplaning

1. **Heavy Rainfall**: Driving through a heavy downpour, where water quickly accumulates on the road, increases hydroplaning risk.
2. **Standing Water**: Encountering large puddles or standing water on highways post-storm can cause vehicles to hydroplane unexpectedly.
3. **High-Speed Driving**: Traveling at high speeds during or after rain can lead to loss of tire traction and hydroplaning.
4. **Worn Tires**: Driving with tires that have reduced tread depth in wet conditions can result in hydroplaning, even at lower speeds.


Remember, the key to handling hydroplaning is to stay calm, make gentle adjustments, and prioritize preventive measures like proper tire maintenance and cautious driving in wet conditions. Learn more about [Safe Driving Tips](/drive-better/safety-tips).
