Essential for car rentals abroad, the IDP translates your license into multiple languages and confirms your eligibility to drive on international roads.

## What is an International Driver's License?
An international driver's license (the correct term is "international driving permit", or IDP) is **a document that contains your name, photo and driver information and allows you to drive a motor vehicle legally in 174 countries** when it is accompanied by your valid US driver's license. Many car rental companies abroad require an IDP along with your national driver’s license to rent a vehicle.

<Warning>Many people have seen sales pitches for "international driver's licenses" that claim these licenses can do all kinds of things such as act as a driver's license, act as a means of identification, or hide your identity. None of this is true. International driver's licenses <em>do not exist</em>. There are only international driving permits (IDPs).</Warning>

Here’s everything you need to know about this helpful document that will allow you to get behind the wheel on your perfect business trip or vacation.

## 5 Steps to Obtain an International Driver's Permit for your U.S. Driver's License

<Steps>
  <Step title="Determine Eligibility">
    You must be a permanent US resident at least 18 years old and have a US driver's license that will remain valid for the next six months.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Application Method">
   Decide between applying **in-person** or **by mail.** We recommend in-person application for faster processing. 
   <Info>In the United States, the only organization that issues international driver's licenses (permits) is the **American Automobile Association (AAA)**. (You don't have to be their member.) The US State Department specifically [advises drivers to obtain their international driver's licenses from AAA](https://www.usa.gov/international-drivers-license). The US Federal Trade Commission has warned that any other organization offering IDP services is likely running a scam.</Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Gather Required Documents">
    Complete the IDP application form, provide two original passport-size photos with your signature oth the back, a photocopy of your valid U.S. driver's license, and the $20 fee (plus and applicable state taxes.) 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Submit Application and Fee">
    Pay the **$20 fee** and submit your application either at a AAA branch (in-person) or mail it to AAA (by mail). [Find your local AAA office here](https://www.aaa.com/office/). If abroad, mail your application to the AAA office in the U.S. with all required documents and fee. Expect longer processing and delivery times.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive Your IDP">
    Collect your IDP immediately at an AAA branch or wait for it to arrive by mail (may take 10-15 business days.) An IDP is usually valid for one year from the date of issue, and it cannot be post-dated, extended, or renewed.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Who needs an IDP?">
Anyone planning to drive a vehicle in a foreign country that does not recognize their country's driver's license or requires a translation should obtain an IDP.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What documents do I need to apply for an IDP?">
A completed IDP application form, two passport-sized photos, a photocopy of your valid driver's license, and the $20 application fee are required.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I use my IDP to drive in any country?">
An IDP is widely recognized in 174 countries. However, it's important to check the specific requirements of the country you plan to visit.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Do I still need to carry my national driver's license?">
Yes, an IDP is a supplement to, not a replacement for, your driver's license. You must carry both when driving abroad.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="I am a foreign driver traveling to the US. Can I obtain an IDP in the US?">
If you are coming to the United States from another country and you wish to drive, you must have a valid foreign driver's license and you must obtain an IDP from the same country in which your license was issued. The United States Government does not require you to have an IDP to drive in the US. Some individual states may require you to have an IDP to drive on their public roads, but many other states do not. California, Massachusetts, and Arizona are among the states that require only a valid foreign driver's license, not an IDP. Still, even these states typically recommend that you get an IDP because it will be written in English and hence facilitate communication if you need assistance while driving or are involved in an auto accident.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What should I do if my IDP is lost or stolen while I'm abroad?">
You should contact the issuing authority in your home country to inquire about the replacement process, which may vary.
