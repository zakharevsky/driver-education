## What is an International Driver's License?
An International Driver's License (the correct term is "**international driving permit**", or **IDP**) is a document that allows you to drive a motor vehicle legally in 174 countries when it is accompanied by your valid US driver's license. 

It contains your name, photo and driver information. You are eligible for an IDL/IDP if you are a permanent US resident at least 18 years of age and have a driver's license that will remain valid for at least six months from the date of issuance of the IDP. An international driving permit may also be required or recommended by many rental car agencies. 

Hereâ€™s everything you need to know about this helpful document that will allow you to get behind the wheel on your perfect business trip or vacation.

### It's not recognized everywhere
Your IDL/IDP does not allow you to drive legally in every country, just in those countries that recognize it. Here's a [full list of participating countries](https://www.drivers.com/article/937/). Notably absent from this list is the People's Republic of China. (To drive legally in China, you must have a driver's license issued by China.)

## International Driver's License (International Driving Permit) Basics

## Where to get an International Driver's License
In the United States, only one organization issues international driver's licenses (permits): the American Automobile Association (AAA). The US State Department [advises drivers to obtain them from AAA](https://www.usa.gov/international-drivers-license). The US Federal Trade Commission has warned that any other organization is likely running a scam.
You don't have to be a member of AAA to obtain an international driver's license from that organization. You can apply in person at your local AAA branch. You can [find your local AAA office here](https://www.aaa.com/office/). Alternatively, you can mail the application and supporting documentation to the AAA.

## How to get an International Driver's License
If you are a permanent resident of the United States and have a driver's license issued in the United States, you can obtain your international driver's license (officially referred to as "international driving permit" or IDP) from either the AAA.

**To obtain an IDP from AAA, do the following:**
- **Complete the [AAA IDP application](https://www.aaa.com/vacation/docs/IDP_Application2a.pdf)**. Visit your local AAA branch and bring the completed application; your valid US driver's license; two passport-sized photos of yourself; and cash, a check, or a credit card with which to pay the $20 fee. (However, some branches may not accept cash or certain credit cards, so you want to be sure you have a valid form of payment before you go.) Some AAA branches may also be able to take passport photos of you for an additional fee.
- Alternatively, you can **obtain an IDP from AAA through the mail**. Mail the completed application form [to the address given here](https://www.aaa.com/vacation/idpf.html) along with your two passport photos, photocopies of the front and back of your driver's license, a check or money order for the $20 permit fee, and if you wish, additional postage for your IDP to be sent via expedited mail.

## Requirements for Getting an International Driving Permit

## How to use the International Driver's License / Permit
Your IDP allows you to drive legally in 174 countries. It will not be recognized without your valid US driver's license. An IDP is not proof of driving knowledge or skill, which is why you must also have your driver's license with you.

Your IDP does not entitle you to any additional benefits, discounts, privileges, or rights. Anyone offering an "international driver's license" that can provide more than an IDP does is running a scam.

### I am a foreign driver traveling to the US. Can I obtain an IDP in the US?
If you are coming to the United States from another country and you wish to drive, you must have a valid foreign driver's license and you must obtain an IDP from the same country in which your license was issued.

The United States Government does not require you to have an IDP to drive in the US. Some individual states may require you to have an IDP to drive on their public roads, but many other states do not. California, Massachusetts, and Arizona are among the states that require only a valid foreign driver's license, not an IDP. Still, even these states typically recommend that you get an IDP because it will be written in English and hence facilitate communication if you need assistance while driving or are involved in an auto accident.

### What's the difference between international driving permit and international driver's license?
Many people have seen sales pitches for **"international driver's licenses"** that claim these licenses can do all kinds of things such as act as a driver's license, act as a means of identification, or hide your identity. None of this is true. **International driver's licenses <em>do not exist</em>. There are only international driving permits (IDPs)**. 

In the United States, IDPs are only issued by one organization (AAA). Previously, another organization (AATA) used to issue IDPs, but they [no longer issue them](https://aataidp.com/applicaton/). 

An IDP is a permit, not an ID card or a driver's license, and it won't even be recognized if you don't also hold a valid driver's license.
