## 5 Steps to Obtain Your International Driver's Permit in the U.S.

   Decide between applying **in-person** or **by mail.** 

   <Warning>In the United States, the only organization that issues international driver's licenses (permits) is the **American Automobile Association (AAA)**. (You don't have to be their member.) The US State Department specifically [advises drivers to obtain their international driver's licenses from AAA](https://www.usa.gov/international-drivers-license). The US Federal Trade Commission has warned that any other organization offering IDP services is likely running a scam.</Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Gather Required Documents">
    Complete the IDP application form, provide two original passport-size photos with your signature oth the back, a photocopy of your valid U.S. driver's license, and the $20 fee (plus and applicable state taxes.)

    Pay the **$20 fee** and submit your application either at a AAA branch (in-person) or mail it to AAA (by mail). [Find your local AAA office here](https://www.aaa.com/office/).

  <Step title="Receive Your IDP">
    Collect your IDP immediately at an AAA branch or wait for it to arrive by mail (may take 10-15 business days.) IDPs are valid for one year from the issue date and are not renewable.

Need a deeper dive? Hereâ€™s everything you need to know about this helpful document that will allow you to get behind the wheel on your perfect business trip or vacation.

## What is an International Driver's License?
An International Driver's License (the correct term is "**international driving permit**", or **IDP**) is a document that contains your name, photo and driver information and **allows you to drive a motor vehicle legally in 174 countries** when it is accompanied by your valid US driver's license. An international driving permit may also be required or recommended by many rental car agencies.

### It's not recognized everywhere
Your IDL/IDP does not allow you to drive legally in every country, just in those countries that recognize it. Here's a [full list of participating countries](https://www.drivers.com/article/937/). Notably absent from this list is the People's Republic of China. (To drive legally in China, you must have a driver's license issued by China.)

## International Driver's License (International Driving Permit) Basics

### Why You Might Need an International Driving Permit (IDP):
- **International Travel:** If you plan to drive in a foreign country, an IDP translates your driver's license into 10 languages and is recognized in over 150 countries, easing language barriers and often required for car rentals abroad.

#### Apply While Overseas:
- If abroad and you need an IDP, mail your application to the AAA office in the U.S. with all required documents and fee. Expect longer processing and delivery times.

### Important Considerations:
- **Supplementary Use:** An IDP supplements, not replaces, your U.S. driver's license. Always carry both when driving abroad.
- **Country-Specific Rules:** Check the requirements of the country you're visiting, as some have specific rules beyond needing an IDP.

### I am a foreign driver traveling to the US. Can I obtain an IDP in the US?
If you are coming to the United States from another country and you wish to drive, you must have a valid foreign driver's license and you must obtain an IDP from the same country in which your license was issued.

The United States Government does not require you to have an IDP to drive in the US. Some individual states may require you to have an IDP to drive on their public roads, but many other states do not. California, Massachusetts, and Arizona are among the states that require only a valid foreign driver's license, not an IDP. Still, even these states typically recommend that you get an IDP because it will be written in English and hence facilitate communication if you need assistance while driving or are involved in an auto accident.

### What's the difference between international driving permit and international driver's license?
Many people have seen sales pitches for **"international driver's licenses"** that claim these licenses can do all kinds of things such as act as a driver's license, act as a means of identification, or hide your identity. None of this is true. **International driver's licenses <em>do not exist</em>. There are only international driving permits (IDPs)**.
