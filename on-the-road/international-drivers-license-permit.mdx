## What is an International Driver's License?
<Tip>An International Driver's License (the correct term is "**international driving permit**", or **IDP**) is a document that allows you to drive a motor vehicle legally in 174 countries when it is accompanied by your valid US driver's license.</Tip> 

It contains your name, photo and driver information. You are eligible for an IDL/IDP if you are a permanent US resident at least 18 years of age and have a driver's license that will remain valid for at least six months from the date of issuance of the IDP. An international driving permit may also be required or recommended by many rental car agencies. 

Hereâ€™s everything you need to know about this helpful document that will allow you to get behind the wheel on your perfect business trip or vacation.

### It's not recognized everywhere
Your IDL/IDP does not allow you to drive legally in every country, just in those countries that recognize it. Here's a [full list of participating countries](https://www.drivers.com/article/937/). Notably absent from this list is the People's Republic of China. (To drive legally in China, you must have a driver's license issued by China.)

## International Driver's License (International Driving Permit) Basics

- You must be a permanent US resident at least 18 years of age and have a US driver's license that will remain valid for the next six months.
- Your IDL/IDP lets you drive legally in foreign countries when accompanied by your valid US driver's license.
- It is recognized in 174 countries.
- **Only one organization in the US issues IDPs: Automobile Association of America (AAA)**.
- The fee for an IDP is $20 (as of 2024).
- An IDP can be issued immediately at an AAA branch or may take 10-15 business days by mail from AAA.
- An IDP is valid for one year.

### Why You Might Need an International Driving Permit (IDP):
- **International Travel:** If you plan to drive in a foreign country, an IDP translates your driver's license into 10 languages and is recognized in over 150 countries, easing language barriers and often required for car rentals abroad.

## Where to Get an International Driver's License / Permit
In the United States, only one organization issues international driver's licenses (permits): the American Automobile Association (AAA). The US State Department [advises drivers to obtain them from AAA](https://www.usa.gov/international-drivers-license). The US Federal Trade Commission has warned that any other organization is likely running a scam.
You don't have to be a member of AAA to obtain an international driver's license from that organization. You can apply in person at your local AAA branch. You can [find your local AAA office here](https://www.aaa.com/office/). Alternatively, you can mail the application and supporting documentation to the AAA.

## How to Apply for an International Driver's License / Permit

### Eligibility and Validity:
- **Age and License:** Must be at least 18 years old with a valid U.S. driver's license.
- **Duration:** IDPs are valid for one year from the issue date and are not renewable.

### How to Apply: Step-by-Step Guide

#### Apply In-Person:
1. Locate the nearest AAA branch.
2. Bring a completed IDP application form (available on the AAA website).
3. Provide two original passport photos (available at AAA branches).
4. Show your valid U.S. driver's license.
5. Pay the $20 fee (plus any applicable state taxes).

#### Apply By Mail:
1. Complete the IDP application form.
2. Include two original passport-size photos with your signature on the back.
3. Attach a photocopy of both sides of your valid driver's license.
4. Enclose a $20 fee (check or money order), plus tax where applicable.
5. Mail your application to the specified AAA address, allowing sufficient time for processing and postal delivery.

#### Apply While Overseas:
- If abroad and you need an IDP, mail your application to the AAA office in the U.S. with all required documents and fee. Expect longer processing and delivery times.

### Important Considerations:
- **Supplementary Use:** An IDP supplements, not replaces, your U.S. driver's license. Always carry both when driving abroad.
- **Country-Specific Rules:** Check the requirements of the country you're visiting, as some have specific rules beyond needing an IDP.

## How to use the International Driver's License / Permit
Your IDP allows you to drive legally in 174 countries. It will not be recognized without your valid US driver's license. An IDP is not proof of driving knowledge or skill, which is why you must also have your driver's license with you.

Your IDP does not entitle you to any additional benefits, discounts, privileges, or rights. Anyone offering an "international driver's license" that can provide more than an IDP does is running a scam.

### I am a foreign driver traveling to the US. Can I obtain an IDP in the US?
If you are coming to the United States from another country and you wish to drive, you must have a valid foreign driver's license and you must obtain an IDP from the same country in which your license was issued.

The United States Government does not require you to have an IDP to drive in the US. Some individual states may require you to have an IDP to drive on their public roads, but many other states do not. California, Massachusetts, and Arizona are among the states that require only a valid foreign driver's license, not an IDP. Still, even these states typically recommend that you get an IDP because it will be written in English and hence facilitate communication if you need assistance while driving or are involved in an auto accident.

### What's the difference between international driving permit and international driver's license?
Many people have seen sales pitches for **"international driver's licenses"** that claim these licenses can do all kinds of things such as act as a driver's license, act as a means of identification, or hide your identity. None of this is true. **International driver's licenses <em>do not exist</em>. There are only international driving permits (IDPs)**. 

In the United States, IDPs are only issued by one organization (AAA). Previously, another organization (AATA) used to issue IDPs, but they [no longer issue them](https://aataidp.com/applicaton/). 

An IDP is a permit, **not an ID card or a driver's license**, and it won't even be recognized if you don't also hold a valid driver's license.
