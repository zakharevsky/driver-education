## What is an International Driver's License?
An International Driver's License (the correct term is "International Driving Permit", or IDP) is **a document that allows you to drive a motor vehicle legally in 174 countries** when it is accompanied by your valid US driver's license. This document, issued by the Americal Automobile Association (AAA) in the U.S., contains your name, photo and driver information, translated into 10 languages. Many car rental companies abroad require an IDP along with your national driver’s license to rent a vehicle. 

<Info>Many people have seen sales pitches for "international driver's licenses" that claim these licenses can do all kinds of things such as act as a driver's license, act as a means of identification, or hide your identity. None of this is true. International driver's licenses <em>do not exist</em>. There are only international driving permits (IDPs).</Info>

## 5 Steps to Obtain an International Driver's Permit for Your U.S. Driver's License
<Steps>
  <Step title="Determine Eligibility">
    You must be a permanent US resident at least 18 years old and have a valid US driver's license.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Application Method">
   Decide between applying **in-person** or **by mail.** We recommend in-person application for faster processing times. If abroad and you need an IDP, mail your application to the AAA office in the U.S. with all required documents and fee. Expect longer processing and delivery times.

   <Warning>In the United States, the only organization that issues international driver's licenses (permits) is the **American Automobile Association (AAA)**. (You don't have to be their member.) The US State Department specifically [advises drivers to obtain their international driver's licenses from AAA](https://www.usa.gov/international-drivers-license). The US Federal Trade Commission has warned that any other organization offering IDP services is likely running a scam.</Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Gather Required Documents">
    Complete the [IDP application form](https://www.aaa.com/vacation/docs/IDP_Application2a.pdf), provide two original passport-size photos with your signature oth the back, a photocopy of your U.S. driver's license (must remain valid for the next six months), and the $20 fee (plus and applicable state taxes.) 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Submit Application and Fee">
    Pay the **$20 fee** and submit your application either at a AAA branch (in-person) or mail it to AAA (by mail). [Find your local AAA office here](https://www.aaa.com/office/).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive Your IDP">
    Collect your IDP immediately at an AAA branch or wait for it to arrive by mail (may take 10-15 business days.) An IDP is usually valid for one year from the date of issue, and it cannot be post-dated, extended, or renewed.

Need a deeper dive? Here’s everything you need to know about this helpful document that will allow you to get behind the wheel on your perfect business trip or vacation.

## Important considerations:
- **Supplementary Use:** An IDP supplements, not replaces, your U.S. driver's license. Always carry both when driving abroad.
- **Country-Specific Rules:** Check the requirements of the country you're visiting, as some have specific rules beyond needing an IDP. Your IDP does not allow you to drive legally in every country, just in those countries that recognize it. Here's a [full list of participating countries](https://www.drivers.com/article/937/). Notably absent from this list is the People's Republic of China. (To drive legally in China, you must have a driver's license issued by China.)

## Frequently asked questions about International Driving Permits
<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Who needs an IDP?">
Anyone planning to drive a vehicle in a foreign country that does not recognize their country's driver's license or requires a translation should obtain an IDP.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What documents do I need to apply for an IDP?">
A completed IDP application form, two passport-sized photos, a photocopy of your valid driver's license, and the $20 application fee are required.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do I still need to carry my national driver's license?">
Yes, an IDP is a supplement to, not a replacement for, your national driver's license. You must carry both when driving abroad.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if I'm already overseas and need an IDP?">
You can usually apply for an IDP by mail through authorized organizations in your home country, even if you're currently abroad.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I am a foreign driver traveling to the US. Can I obtain an IDP in the US?">
If you are coming to the United States from another country and you wish to drive, you must have a valid foreign driver's license and you must obtain an IDP from the same country in which your license was issued.

The United States Government [does not require you to have an IDP to drive in the US](https://www.usa.gov/visitors-driving). Some individual states may require you to have an IDP to drive on their public roads, but many other states do not. California, Massachusetts, and Arizona are among the states that require only a valid foreign driver's license, not an IDP. Still, even these states typically recommend that you get an IDP because it will be written in English and hence facilitate communication if you need assistance while driving or are involved in an auto accident.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What should I do if my IDP is lost or stolen while I'm abroad?">
You should contact the issuing authority in your home country to inquire about the replacement process, which may vary.
