## Replace or Renew Your Driverâ€™s License in Arizona

### In Person

Your license expires every 5 years and has to be renewed. You may renew your license up to six months before its expiration date.

**Plan of Action:**
1. Apply at your local [MVD office](https://driving-tests.org/dmv-near-me/arizona-dmv-office-locations/) or [authorized third-party driver license provider](http://www.azdot.gov/mvd/driver-services/ATP-driver-license-locations).
2. Fill out and submit [Form 40-5122](https://www.azdot.gov/docs/default-source/mvd-forms-pubs/40-5122.pdf). If you have any medical conditions that you wish to have shown on your license, submit a statement from your physician or nurse practitioner.
3. Pass a vision test.
4. Submit your existing license as your primary documentation and one more document from [this list](http://azdot.gov/docs/default-source/mvd-forms-pubs/96-0155.pdf?sfvrsn=16) as your secondary documentation.
5. Have a new photo taken.
6. Pay a $10 licensing fee.

Receive a temporary license that will be valid for 30 days. Your permanent license should be mailed to your address before your temporary license expires.

### By Mail

**If you are in the military and stationed outside Arizona**, submit a notarized [driver license application](http://www.azdot.gov/docs/default-source/mvd-forms-pubs/40-5122.pdf?sfvrsn=23), a photocopy of the front and back of your current driver license and military ID card, and a check or money order for $10.00. Send it to the address below:

**Motor Vehicle Division P.O. Box 2100 MD 510 Phoenix, AZ 85001**

**If you are on active duty in the military:** Notify MVD about your active military status. Once MVD knows you're on active duty, you will not be required to renew your license until six months after you have been discharged from the military. This is an automatic extension, you don't have to specially apply for it.

**If you'll be out of state on your expiration date:** You may mail an extension letter to the MVD, requesting an extension. You must include a payment of $5 for the extension. You may pay this fee by credit card, cash, check, traveler's check, or money order (payable to Motor Vehicle Division).
