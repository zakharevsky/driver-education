## Replace or Renew Your Driver License in Arkansas

### In Person

You must renew your license in person at your local [DFA Revenue Office](https://www.dfa.arkansas.gov/office-locations/).

**Plan of Action:**
1. Pay any unpaid traffic tickets or traffic fines in advance.
2. Provide your license.
3. Take a vision exam again if required.
4. Pass a written knowledge test _if your license expired more than 31 days ago_. You will take this exam at an Arkansas [State Police testing site](http://asp.arkansas.gov/services-and-programs/detail/driver-examination).
5. Pay **a 40-dollar renewal fee** by credit card (Visa, MasterCard, or Discover), cash, or check payable to the Department of Finance and Administration. If you pay by credit card, you must pay an additional $2 fee.

### By Mail

Usually, you must renew in person at a DFA Revenue Office. However, if you are out of Arkansas on your license’s expiration date because of work, school, or military duty, you can renew your license by mail. You will need to call Driver’s License Issuance at 501-682-7059 to see if you qualify for a by mail renewal.
