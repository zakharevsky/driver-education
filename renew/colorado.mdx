## Replace or Renew Your Driver License in Colorado

### In Person

You can renew your license at any DMV office in person if you wish, but you *must* renew in person if any of the following is true about you:

* You are upgrading from a minor driver license to an adult driver license.

* You hold an SB251 license.

* You are older than 65 years of age.

* You have a Social Security number that is not on file at the DMV.

* You need to repeat the written or drive skills tests at a DMV office.

* You have unpaid traffic tickets.

* You have a poor payment record with the DMV (such as bad checks).

* Your name has changed.

* You have not had an eye examination by an optometrist or ophthalmologist within the last three years.

* You have already received two consecutive renewals online.

You wish to have a new photograph of yourself taken.

**Plan of Action:**

1. **Schedule an appointment or walk in:** Walk-ins are usually accepted at [DMV offices](https://driving-tests.org/dmv-near-me/colorado-dmv-office-locations/), but you can [make an appointment](https://coloradodor.hosted.acftechnologies.com/WAColorado/ACFCustom/Service.aspx) to help shorten your wait. Note that you must make an appointment to renew your [SB251 license](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/dmv/co-rcsa-sb251-driver-licenses-and-ids).

2. **Bring documentation:**

   * Your driver license.

   * One document to verify your [current Colorado address](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/dmv/proof-address) (e.g., a bill, rental or mortgage contract, etc.). If you have changed your address or your license expired more than one year ago, you must supply *two* documents proving your residency in Colorado.

   * Proof of your Social Security Number (card, W2, etc.) unless you renew the SB251 license.

   * A document to demonstrate lawful presence in the U.S. (only required for U.S. citizens and permanent residents whose driver license is currently expired). Please see the [DR2300A](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/DR2300.pdf) for document ideas.

3. **Pass a vision examination:** The minimum vision standard is 20/40.

4. **Pay the fee:** $26.00 for a regular license; $79.58 for an SB251 license paid by cash, check, or card.

5. **Have your picture and fingerprints taken.**

6. **Wait for your license:** The DMV should mail you your new license within the next 30 days. You will *not* receive a temporary license, so you should consider renewing at least 30 days before your license expires. (It is illegal to drive with an expired license.) If you have not received your new license after 30 days, contact the DMV office where you applied for it or call 303-205-5948.

**If your driver license expired more than a year ago,** you cannot renew it; you must go through all the steps [to apply for a new driver license](#level-5).

Drivers turning 21 years old cannot renew their driver's license prior to their birthday. Drivers age 22 years old or older may renew their license at any time prior to the expiration date.

### By Mail

If you are eligible to renew your license by mail, the DMV should mail you a renewal application before your license expires. Alternatively, to check if you are eligible to renew by mail, visit the DMV [Renew by Mail](https://mydmv.colorado.gov/_/) webpage and follow the instructions.

If you are eligible:

1. Download the renewal application from there.

2. Fill it out and mail it along with payment of the renewal fee to the address on the application.

The renewal fee is $26.00 for a regular license or $79.58 for an SB251 license, which you must pay with a check payable to the Colorado Department of Revenue (DOR).

You should receive your new license in the mail within 30 days. You will *not* receive a temporary license in the interim, so you should consider renewing at least 30 days before your license expires.

**If you are out of Colorado** when it's time to renew your license, you may apply for a one-year extension (three years for active duty military) or a reissue while out of state but only if you have a regular license. Complete form [DR2989](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/DR2989.pdf) and follow instructions contained on the form.
