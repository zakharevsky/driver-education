## Replace or Renew Your Driverâ€™s License in Connecticut

### In Person

You can renew your license as early as 6 months prior to its expiration. Note that there is **a late fee** for renewing an expired license.

Normally, you must renew your driver license in person, either at [any DMV office](https://driving-tests.org/dmv-near-me/connecticut-dmv-office-locations/) or at [an AAA office](http://www.ct.gov/dmv/cwp/view.asp?a=808\&q=244578) that handles renewals of Connecticut licenses.

You must renew at a DMV office if:

* You have a [Drive Only License](http://www.ct.gov/dmv/cwp/view.asp?a=805\&q=547212).

* You are not a US citizen but want to get [a verified driver's license](http://www.ct.gov/dmv/cwp/view.asp?a=4078\&q=477752).

* You are requesting a gender change.

**Plan of Action:**

1. **Bring the required documentation:**

   * Your license.

   * Your renewal application form that you received in the mail. If you have not received a renewal notice, call the License Processing Unit at 860-263-5148. Have your license number available when you call.

2. **Pay the renewal fee of 72.00.** If your old license already expired, you will be charged an additional 25.00 late fee. If you renew at an AAA office, you will be charged an additional 5.00 convenience fee. If you are at least 65 years of age, you may request a two-year driver license, for which the license fee is $24.00.

3. **Receive your temporary card.** Your new license will arrive in mail. You can track its delivery [here](https://dmvcardtrack.ct.gov/credentialtrackingweb/).

**If you have changed your name**, you must also [have Social Security update your name](https://faq.ssa.gov/link/portal/34011/34019/Article/3749/How-do-I-change-or-correct-my-name-on-my-Social-Security-number-card), fill out and provide a [Change of Name or Name Correction Request (Form E-78)](http://www.ct.gov/dmv/LIB/dmv/20/29/E-78.pdf) to the DMV and *certified* documentation that verifies your change of name (such as a marriage certificate or divorce decree).

**If you don't have a gold star "verified" license** but want to get one, you should also present the following at the DMV:

* 2 forms of identification.

* SSN.

* Proof of residency.

* Proof of legal presence in the US (for Non-US born).

Choose the documents with the help of [this list](http://www.ct.gov/dmv/cwp/view.asp?a=805\&q=244772).

**To request a gender change**, fill out Part 1 of the [Gender Designation Change Form](http://www.ct.gov/dmv/lib/dmv/20/29/b-372.pdf) and have a medical professional fill out Part 2. Provide the form to the DMV.

**If your license expired more than two years ago**, you will have [to apply for a new driver's license](#level-5) as if you've never had one.

### By Mail

You can renew your regular license (not a Drive Only license) by email, mail, or fax, **only if** you are unable to appear in person at a DMV office or an AAA office for one of the following reasons:

* You are actively serving in the US armed forces.

* You have a major health condition.

* You are out of the state or out of the country.

* You are incarcerated.

**Plan of Action:**

1. Fill out a [Form B-350](http://www.ct.gov/dmv/lib/dmv/b-350.pdf).

2. If you are renewing by mail because of a major health condition, also fill out [Form CI-1](http://www.ct.gov/dmv/lib/dmv/20/29/ci-1.pdf).

3. If you are renewing by mail because you are actively serving in the US armed forces, you may request a waiver of the renewal fee by also filling out [Form B-88](http://www.ct.gov/dmv/cwp/view.asp?a=818\&q=245034).

4. If you are renewing by mail because you are incarcerated, provide your inmate number and the address of your facility. (That is the only address to which the DMV will send your new license.)

5. Mail the documents and a self-addressed stamped envelope to the following address:

Department of Motor Vehicles 60 State Street Wethersfield, CT 06109 Attention: Mail-in License Transaction Unit

Or email the documents to [DMV.CIU@ct.gov](mailto:DMV.CIU@ct.gov) or fax them to 860-263-5591.

1. **Pay the *$72.00 renewal fee*** with a check or money order payable to the DMV, mail it along with the documents. To pay by credit card, wait 5 business days after you have mailed the documents and then call the Mail-in License Transaction Unit at (860) 263-5401 to pay the fee with your credit card. If you emailed or faxed your documents, wait one business day and call the number above to pay the fee with your credit card.

**If the documents do not reach the DMV before your license expires**, you will be responsible for paying an additional *$25.00 late fee*. Hence, you should send them to the DMV at least 10 days before your license expires.
