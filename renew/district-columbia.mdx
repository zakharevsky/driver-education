## Replace or Renew Your Driver License in Washington, DC

### In Person
If you do not qualify for online renewal, you can always renew your license at any [DC DMV Service center](https://driving-tests.org/dmv-near-me/district-columbia-dmv-office-locations/) without an appointment.

#### Plan of Action
<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1">
    Verify your identity and age. Choose documents from this [list](https://dmv.dc.gov/node/1115566) for a real ID license or this [list](https://dmv.dc.gov/node/1115407) for a Limited Purpose license.

    If you have changed your name so that it no longer matches that on your documentation, you must have [Social Security](https://faq.ssa.gov/link/portal/34011/34019/Article/3749/How-do-I-change-or-correct-my-name-on-my-Social-Security-number-card) update your name, then you will verify the name change at the DMV with documentation selected from this [list](https://dmv.dc.gov/node/1115442).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2">
    Verify your residency in the District with documentation selected from this [list](https://dmv.dc.gov/node/1115502).
  </Step>

    Verify your Social Security number or prove that you are ineligible for one. Choose documentation from this [list](https://dmv.dc.gov/node/1115577).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 4">
    Pay the renewal fee of $47.00 by card, check, money order, or cash (cash isn't accepted at the Brentwood Road Test and CDL Office).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 5">
    Get your temporary license. Your permanent license will be mailed to you within 10 days. While you are waiting to receive it, you can check its mailing status [online](https://dc.dmv-portal.com/home).
  </Step>

**If your license expired more than 545 days ago**, you will have to pass both [a knowledge test](#dmv-knowledge-test) and [a road test](#dmv-driving-test).
