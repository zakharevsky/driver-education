## Replace or Renew Your Driver License in Florida

### In Person

You may renew your driver license in person at a DHSMV Driver License Service Center. However, if you are not eligible to renew online or by mail, you must renew in person.

#### Plan of Action

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1">
    Bring the documentation to verify your identity. Use these ideas to select documentation:

    * If you are a US citizen, check [here](https://www.flhsmv.gov/driver-licenses-id-cards/what-to-bring/u-s-citizen/)

    * If you are an immigrant, check [here](https://www.flhsmv.gov/driver-licenses-id-cards/what-to-bring/immigrant/)

    * If you are Canadian, check [here](https://www.flhsmv.gov/driver-licenses-id-cards/what-to-bring/canadian/)

    * If you are a non-immigrant from a country other than Canada, check [here](https://www.flhsmv.gov/driver-licenses-id-cards/what-to-bring/non-immigrant/)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 2">
    Pay the renewal fee: 48 dollars + $15 late fee (if applicable).
  </Step>
</Steps>

**If you have legally changed your name** so that it no longer matches that on your documentation, you must also have the Social Security Administration update your name before you provide that documentation to the Driver License Service Center. Submit either the original or a certified copy of documentation verifying your change of name, such as a state-issued marriage certificate, divorce decree, etc. Photocopies are not acceptable. If you are not a US citizen, you should also have your name changed on your US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) documents.

Even if your license expired as long as one year ago, you should still be able to renew it. However, you will have to pay a late fee of $15.00, and the DHSMV may require you to retake the knowledge test. If your license expired more than one year ago, you cannot renew it; you must apply for a new license!

### By Mail

If the DHSMV finds you eligible to renew your license by mail, it will mail you a renewal application and instructions about 45 days before your license expires. Follow those instructions to renew by mail. It takes time for the DHSMV to receive and process your renewal application. Therefore, renew as soon as possible so that your existing license will not expire before you receive your new one. (It is illegal to drive without a valid license.)

Renewal fee: 48 dollars + $15 late fee (if applicable).

### Online

You can renew online and have your new license mailed to you in 7 to 10 days only if you meet all of the following requirements:

1. You are either a US citizen or a permanent resident.

2. Your license complies with the new federal [REAL ID requirements](https://www.flhsmv.gov/driver-licenses-id-cards/real-id/). (Florida started issuing real ID compliant driver licenses on January 1, 2010.)

3. Your license is currently valid, or it expired no longer than one year ago.

4. Your last license renewal was done in person at a Driver License Service Center.

5. You do not need to retake the vision test, hearing test, written knowledge test, or driving test at a Driver License Service Center.

6. Your name has not changed.

7. Your address has not changed.

Renewal fee: 48 dollars + 2 dollars service fee + $15 late fee (if applicable).
