## Replace or Renew Your Driver's License in Georgia

### In Person

You may renew your driver license in person [at a DDS Customer Service Center](https://driving-tests.org/dmv-near-me/georgia-dds-office-locations/). However, if you are not eligible to renew online or by mail, you *must* renew in person.

To renew in person, you must meet the following requirements and submit the following items to a Customer Service Center:
1. Fill out an application for a driver license. You can fill out the application [online](https://online.dds.ga.gov/onlineservices/preapply/login.aspx) ahead of time or at a Service Center.
2. Bring documentation to verify the following:
   - Your identity, including your full name
   - Your date of birth
   - Your Social Security number or proof of ineligibility for a Social Security number
   - Your US citizenship (or your legal presence in the US if you are not a US citizen)
   - Your residential address in Georgia
   - Use this [list](http://online.dds.ga.gov/SecureID/accepteddocs.aspx) to select documents.
3. Surrender your existing driver license.
4. Have your picture taken.
5. Pay the license *renewal fee of $32*.

**Tip!** Even if your license expired more than two years ago, you may still be able to renew it, but you will be required to pass a vision test, a knowledge exam, and a road test again. Once you meet the above requirements, youâ€™ll be issued an interim (temporary) driver license. Your permanent license should be mailed to you within 30 days.
