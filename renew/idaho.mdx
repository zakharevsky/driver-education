## Replace or Renew Your Driver License in Idaho

### In Person

You may renew your driver's license in person at any driver’s licensing office. To locate a nearby office, use this [map](https://driving-tests.org/dmv-near-me/idaho-dmv-office-locations/).

However, if **any** of the following applies to you, you **must** renew your license in person at a DMV office:
- You are younger than 21 years of age.
- You are older than 69 years of age.
- Your license expired more than 25 months ago.
- You obtained an extension of your current (expiring) license.
- You already renewed by mail at least once within the last 8 years.

**Plan of Action:**
1. **Apply in person**: You can apply on a walk-in basis at a driver's licensing office close to you. Use [this map](https://driving-tests.org/dmv-near-me/idaho-dmv-office-locations/) to locate DMV offices. Not all offices offer driver license services, so check before you go.
2. **Provide documentation required**: You must verify the following:
   - Your identity, including your full name
   - Your date of birth
   - Your Social Security number (unless you are a temporary foreign national who isn't authorized for employment)
   - Your US citizenship (or your lawful presence in the US if you are not a US citizen)
   - Your residential address in Idaho
   Use the interactive [Add the Star](http://itd.idaho.gov/starcard/add-the-star-tool-01.html) tool to choose the correct documentation easily.
   If you have legally changed your name so that it no longer matches that on your documentation, you must also have the Social Security Administration [update your name](https://faq.ssa.gov/link/portal/34011/34019/Article/3749/How-do-I-change-or-correct-my-name-on-my-Social-Security-number-card) before you go and bring the legal proof of your new name ( e.g. a certified marriage certificate, certified divorce decree, etc.).
3. **Complete an application form**: The forms are not available online; instead, you must get it at the DMV office.
4. **Pass a vision test**: You must meet a minimum standard of 20/40 vision in at least one eye, with or without corrective lenses.
5. **Pay the fee**: Pay by card (American Express, Discover Card, MasterCard, or Visa), cash, check, or money order. The license fee varies depending on the period of validity of the license:
   - Three-year license (ages 18-20): $25.00
   - Four-year license (ages 21 and older): $30.00
   - Eight-year license (ages 21-62 at your choice): $55.00
   If you are not a US citizen, the license may expire earlier at the end of your lawful stay in the US.
6. **Surrender your expiring license and receive a temporary one**: Your plastic license should be mailed to you within about three weeks.

**If your license expired no longer than 25 months ago**, you should still be able to renew it without taking additional tests.
**If your license expired more than 25 months ago**, you will be required to pass a written knowledge test and a skills (road) test again.

### By Mail

You can renew by mail **only if all** of the following apply to you:
- You are at least 21 years of age but younger than 70 years of age.
- Your license did not expire more than 25 months ago.
- You have not renewed by mail within the last eight years.
- You did not obtain an extension of your current (expiring) license.

If you are eligible to renew by mail, the DMV will send you an application for renewal by mail. To renew by mail, do the following:
1. Fill out the application for renewal by mail.
2. Request an eight-year driver's or a usual four-year license.
3. Mail the application, your payment of the renewal fee, and your payment of an additional sheriff's administrative fee (for renewing by mail) to the address provided on the application. The fees are as follows:
   - Sheriff's administrative fee: $1.00
   - Four-year license (ages 21 and older): $30.00
   - Eight-year license (ages 21–62 at your choice): $55.00
   Pay with a check, money order, or credit card (MasterCard or Visa). However, if you pay by credit card, there may be an additional service charge.
4. You will receive your new plastic license in the mail. Destroy your expiring license because it will no longer be valid.
