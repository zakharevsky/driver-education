## Renew Your Driver’s License in Illinois

### In Person

The Secretary of State's office will mail you a renewal letter 60 to 90 days before your license expires to remind you [to renew it](https://driving-tests.org/beginner-drivers/how-to-renew-your-driver%E2%80%99s-license/). The letter will describe the renewal options available to you.

You always have the option to renew your driver's license in person at any convenient [Driver Services Facility](https://driving-tests.org/dmv-near-me/illinois-dmv-office-locations/).

**Plan of Action:**

1. Apply in person on a walk-in basis at [a Secretary of State Facility](https://www.ilsos.gov/facilityfinder/facility).

2. Complete an application form (available at the Facility).

3. Pass a vision test.

4. Present your current driver's license to verify your identity. If something about your identity has changed, verify the change with supporting documents.

5. Have your picture taken.

6. Pay the renewal fee based on your age:

   * Ages 21–68: $30.00

   * Ages 69–80: $5.00

   * Ages 81–86: $2.00

   * Ages 87 and older: Free
     The fee can be paid by card, check, or cash.

The Driver Services Facility will issue you a temporary (paper) driver's license, which will be valid for 90 days. Your permanent (plastic) license should be mailed to you within 15 business days. If you don't receive it, you can check its status [online](https://www.ilsos.gov/dlstatus) or by calling (217) 782-7044.

You will also take a written test once in 8 years while renewing your license if you have any traffic convictions. If you have an accident recorded on your driving record, you may be required to take the road exam as well.

**If your license expired more than a year ago**, you will have to pass vision, written, and road tests.

### By Mail

You can renew by mail only if the renewal letter sent to you by the Secretary of State's office says so. In this case, follow the instructions in the letter.

After your renewal application is processed, the Secretary of State's office will mail your new license to you within 15 business days. You **will not** receive a temporary (paper) license in the meantime. Therefore, consider renewing at least 30 days before your existing license expires to ensure that your new license will arrive in time.
