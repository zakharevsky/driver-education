## Renew Your Indiana Driver’s License

### In Person

If you have a full license, you may renew it up to one year before it expires unless you are a lawful temporary resident (foreign national), in which case you may renew it up to 30 days before it expires. If you have a probationary driver's license, it cannot be renewed until one day after your 21st birthday.

You always have the option to renew your driver's license in person at any convenient BMV branch office. However, you must renew in person if you don't meet the requirements for renewing online. No appointment is required, just visit [a BMV branch](https://driving-tests.org/dmv-near-me/indiana-bmv-office-locations/) convenient to you.

**Plan of Action:**
1. **Submit an application**: The form is available at BMV offices.
2. **Verify your identity if needed**: Foreign nationals with permanent or temporary lawful status must bring the documentation verifying the following:
   - Your legal name
   - Your signature
   - Your date of birth
   - Your lawful status in the US
   - Your Social Security number (or your ineligibility for a Social Security number)
   - Your residential address in Indiana

   All applicants must bring documentation to verify name changes, residential addresses, or other personal information.
3. **Pass a vision test**: If your visual ability does not meet state standards, you will be referred to an eye doctor for examination. You may return with a statement from an eye doctor certifying that your vision has been corrected to meet the standard.
4. **Pay the fee**:
   - Ages 21–74: $17.50 (for a six-year license)
   - Ages 75–84: $11.00 (for a three-year license)
   - Ages 85 and older: $7.00 (for a two-year license)
   You can pay by cash, check, or card (Master Card or Visa).
5. **Surrender your current license**.

The BMV branch office will issue you a new temporary driver's license valid for 30 days. The BMV should mail you your new permanent driver's license within 14 days. If you haven't received it by then, contact the BMV at 888-692-6841 or visit a BMV branch office in person.

**Even if your driver's license expired as long as 179 days ago**, you can still renew it, but you'll have to pay a $6.00 late fee.
**If your license expired at least 180 days ago**, you'll also have to pass a vision test and a knowledge exam again.
**If your license expired more than three years ago**, you'll have to pass all three tests again: a vision test, a knowledge exam, and a driving skills test.

If you are out of Indiana when your driver's license expires and can't renew online, you may request an extension of 30 days past your license expiration date. To get the extension, fill out the form [Request for Interim/Extension License](https://forms.in.gov/Download.aspx?id=9451) (Form 54580) and mail it to the address shown at the top of the form.

### Online

You may renew your license online only if you meet **all** of the following requirements:

- You renewed in person at a BMV office the last time you renewed.

**To renew online, do the following:**
1. Login to your account at [the BMV website](https://secure.in.gov/BMV/mybmv/Default.aspx).
2. If you don't already have an account, visit [here](https://secure.in.gov/BMV/mybmv/UserRegistration/NewAcct.aspx) instead and register an account for yourself. Then login to your new account as in the previous step.
3. When prompted, enter your name, address, date of birth, and Social Security number.
4. Pay the fee by E-check or card (Mastercard or Visa).
   - Ages 21–74: $17.50 (for a six-year license)
