## Replace or Renew Your Driver License in Iowa

### In Person
Your license expires on the expiration date printed on the license; however, the license is valid for driving for an additional 60 days after the expiration date. (This 60-day grace period does not apply to licenses that are issued to foreign nationals.)

You can always renew your license in person at one of [100 Iowa issuance sites](https://iowadot.gov/mvd/iowa-dot-locations), but you **must** renew in person if you are not eligible to renew online.

#### Plan of Action
<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1">
    Apply in person without an appointment.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2">
    Bring your license and provide documents to verify your:
    - Age and identity
    - Iowa residence
    - Social Security Number

    Use [this interactive guide](https://iowadot.gov/mvd/realid/success.aspx) to collect your documents quickly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 3">
    Pass the vision test.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 4">
    Surrender your current driver’s license.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 5">
    Pay the fee of $4.00 per year.

    Until Dec. 31, 2018, Iowa driver’s licenses will be issued with a randomly assigned expiration date between five and eight years.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 6">
    Your new license will arrive by mail within 21 days. You can check its status [here](https://mymvd.iowadot.gov/Account/Login?ReturnUrl=%2fCredentialHistory).
  </Step>
</Steps>

**If your license has been expired for more than one year and 60 days**, you will have to pass the vision screening, and the knowledge and driving tests.

**You can also renew your license at a self-service kiosk if:**
- You are between 18 and 70 years old
- You are a US citizen
- You don’t need to make any changes in your name, sex, class type or restrictions

Learn [here](https://iowadot.gov/mvd/kiosks) how self-service kiosks work.

### By Mail
If you are temporarily out of state, are unable to renew your driver's license in person and are not eligible to renew online, you may apply for a temporary extension by mail.

Note that the extension mustn’t exceed six months.

#### Plan of Action
<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1">
    Make a request in writing within 30 days before or 60 days after the expiration date.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2">
    Provide an out-of-state address and/or out-of-state fax number.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 3">
    Mail or fax your request to:

    Driver & Identification Services  
    Iowa Department of Transportation  
    P.O. Box 9204  
    Des Moines, Iowa 50306-9204  
    Fax: 515-239-1837
