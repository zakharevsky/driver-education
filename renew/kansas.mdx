## Renew Your Driver’s License in Kansas

### In Person

At least 30 days prior to the expiration of your license, the Division of Vehicles will mail you a notice to the address on file. You can renew your license up to one year in advance unless you are less than 21 years of age. If you are turning 21, you can't renew before your birthday, but should do it as soon as possible after your 21st birthday (you have 45 days to do it).

**Plan of Action:**

1. Apply at any [full-service DMV office](https://driving-tests.org/dmv-near-me/kansas-dmv-office-locations/) or county treasurer location on a walk-in basis or get in line online by using [the Q-Flow system](http://getinline.kdor.ks.gov/WebAppt/WizardTicket/Services) if you apply in Mission, Olathe, Wyandotte, Andover, Wichita, Derby, Topeka, and Manhattan.

2. Provide proof of the following:Use [this checklist](https://www.ksrevenue.org/pdf/de56a.pdf) for more ideas for selecting documents.

   * Your identity (bring your expiring license)

   * Social Security number

   * Kansas residency and your principal residence address (could be the [renewal card](https://www.ksrevenue.org/img/ren_card.jpg) you received in the mail if it shows your principal address)

3. Pass a vision exam.

4. Pay the fee of $26 for a 6-year license. An additional $1.00 will be charged if your license has expired.

5. Have your picture taken.

**If the driver license has been expired for more than 1 year**, you will also have to take the written and driving examinations.

Note that a driver's license examiner may also require any applicant to pass a written or driving skills test if they suspect the applicant is unable to exercise ordinary and reasonable control of a vehicle.

* You are a US citizen or can provide lawful presence documents along with the application.
