## Renew Your Driver’s License in Kentucky

### In Person

You may renew your license up to 6 months prior to the expiration date if you are older than 21. Note that the Kentucky Department of Transportation has stopped mailing reminder notices to drivers whose licenses are about to expire. That is why it's important to check your license expiration date regularly.

**Plan of Action:**

1. Apply in person at the [Circuit Clerk’s Office](https://driving-tests.org/dmv-near-me/kentucky-dmv-office-locations/) of your county of residence.

2. Bring your Kentucky driver’s license.

3. Pay the fee of $20.

4. If your address has changed, bring proof of your new residency.

5. If your name has changed, bring the original document certifying the change.

If your license is expired for more than one year, a vision and written test will be required.

### By Mail

Kentucky Law allows only military personnel to be issued a Class D Driver's License by mail. All other drivers must appear in the Circuit Court Clerk's office. If you are in the military, contact the Circuit Court Clerk's office in the Kentucky county of residence for an application and instructions.
