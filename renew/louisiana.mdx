## Renew Your Driverâ€™s License in Louisiana

### In Person

Your license will expire 6 years from your nearest birthday. You may renew your license anytime within 180 days before the expiration date. You must renew your driver's license in person at [a local OMV office](https://driving-tests.org/dmv-near-me/louisiana-dmv-office-locations/) unless you received a mail-in invitation to renew by mail or online. There is a late fee of $15.00 if your license is expired for more than 10 days.

**Plan of Action:**
1. Visit your local Office of Motor Vehicles (OMV). Use [the map](https://driving-tests.org/dmv-near-me/louisiana-dmv-office-locations/) to choose the one near you.
2. Provide the following documents:
   - Your current driver's license or another legal document to establish your identity and legal residency
   - Proof of liability insurance for every vehicle you own
   - SSN card
   - Non-immigrant Resident Aliens may also present the current passport with documentation from Homeland Security indicating your status in the United States. You may be required to present additional forms of identification, depending on your status in the US.
   - To receive a real ID license, you should also provide one primary and two secondary documents to establish your identity and two documents verifying your home address.
3. Pass the vision test.
4. Pay the fee of $32.25 + $15.00 late fee if applicable. Cash and cards are accepted.

You will receive a temporary license to use until your permanent driver's license arrives in the mail.

If your license has been expired **a year or more**, you must take the vision and [knowledge exams](#dmv-knowledge-test). If you let it expire **for 2 years or more**, you'll be required to take the vision, knowledge, and [driving exams](#dmv-driving-test).

### By Mail

You may renew your license by mail only if you are selected by the OMV. In this case, you will receive a computer-generated invitation and the application form with all the instructions. If you need to change personal information (address, name, etc.), you will have to visit the office.

If you renewed your license by mail or online last time, you will have to visit an OMV office this time.
