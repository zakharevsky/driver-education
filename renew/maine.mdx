## Replace or Renew Your Driver License in Maine

### In Person

You can renew your driver license in person by going to [any BMV branch office](https://driving-tests.org/dmv-near-me/maine-dmv-office-locations/) or [mobile unit sites](https://www.maine.gov/sos/bmv/locations/index.html#mobile) on or before the expiration date or as early as 6 months prior to your license expiration. If your driver license expires, you may be asked to retake the written test.

**Plan of Action:**
1. **Bring documentation:**
   - Proof of Maine residency. Check suitable documents [here](http://www.maine.gov/sos/bmv/licenses/residency.html).
   - Proof of legal presence. For acceptable documents for US citizens go [here](https://www.maine.gov/sos/bmv/licenses/citizen.html), for non-citizens, check [here](https://www.maine.gov/sos/bmv/licenses/noncitizen.html).
   - Your Social Security number (If you believe you do not qualify for a social security number, you must present an unexpired immigration document, such as an I-94, or a written statement from the Social Security Administration about your ineligibility.)
   - Your current Maine driver license
2. **Pass a vision test** (required at the first license renewal after attaining age 40, at every 2nd renewal after that, and at every license renewal after attaining age 62.)
3. **Pay the renewal fee** of $30.00 (if age 65+, pay $21.00) by cash, check (made out to the Secretary of State), money order, Visa, MasterCard, or Discover.
4. **Receive a temporary license** which will be effective for 60 days. Your permanent license will be mailed to you in 2-3 weeks. If you have not received your license within 60 days, call 624-9000, ext. 52114.
