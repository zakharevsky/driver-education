## How to Renew Your Driverâ€™s License in Maryland

### In Person
You will get the MVA renewal notice 60 days prior to your license expiration. It will arrive by mail or email. The notice will mention if you are eligible to renew online and by mail, or if you will have to do it in person. Note that if you are under 40 and eligible to renew online, you won't be able to renew at an MDOT MVA branch office counter.

#### Plan of Action
<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1">
    Start the process and check the documents you are required to provide [here](http://www.mva.maryland.gov/mvaonline/index.htm).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2">
    If you have changed your name since your last renewal, you must change it with the Social Security Administration before coming to the MVA and bring the appropriate documentation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 3">
    Arrive in person at any [MDOT MVA branch office](https://driving-tests.org/dmv-near-me/maryland-mva-office-locations/). You don't need an appointment.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 4">
    Pass the vision test.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 5">
    Provide either a new photograph or the documents required.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 6">
    Pay the fee of $6.00 per year. The fee will depend upon the length of your new license validity, which will be generated by the computer. The maximum length is 8 years. Pay by card, cash, or a check made payable to the Motor Vehicle Administration.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 7">
    Surrender your current license.
  </Step>
</Steps>

If your driver's license is **expired for more than one year**, you will be required to pass [the knowledge test](#dmv-knowledge-test) and [the skills test](#dmv-driving-test) and provide all the documents as if you are a new applicant. You won't need to get a learner's permit, though. Start your application [online](http://license.mva.maryland.gov/CheckList/).

Note that **drivers who are turning 21 years of age** can renew their driver's licenses 7 days before they turn 21.

### By Mail
You may renew by mail only if your renewal notice says so. To make sure your new license arrives before your old one expires, submit your "mail in renewal" application at least 15 days before your license expires. If you find any errors in your information, you must visit an MVA office to renew in person.

#### Plan of Action
<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1">
    Complete your renewal application.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2">
    Have your doctor complete and sign the "vision certification" portion of your renewal form (if over 40). If you use a separate form, you must renew in person.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 3">
    Mail in your renewal with the proper fee ($6.00 per year).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 4">
    If you need to change your address, [click here](https://securetransactions.mva.maryland.gov/emvastore/MainMenu.aspx?startworkflow=changeofaddressplugin) before renewal by mail.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 5">
    Destroy your old license when you receive your new one.
  </Step>

Drivers aged 40 and over must have their vision results submitted electronically by an [Authorized Online Vision Certification Provider](https://egov.maryland.gov/mva/vision/ProviderListing/Index).
