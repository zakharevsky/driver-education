## Renew Your Driver License in Massachusetts

### In Person

You can renew your driver's license up to 1 year before its expiration date. It's your responsibility to check your license expiration date and act accordingly. If your license has been expired more than 2 years, you will need to take the learner's permit exam and road test.

You will be required to renew in person if you want to get a Real ID driver's license for the first time. Use [The RMV's Real ID, Real Answers Wizard](https://www.mass.gov/decision-tree/real-id-real-answers-a-tool-to-help-you-determine-if-you-need-a-real-id) to see whether you need a Standard or Real ID driver's license.

You must renew in person at one of the full or limited [RMV Service Centers](https://www.mass.gov/orgs/massachusetts-registry-of-motor-vehicles/locations) if:

* You renew for the first time

* You need to change your name

* You do not have an SSN

* You are 75 years of age or older

* You have outstanding obligations

* You have not established lawful presence

* You are requesting a first-time issuance of a Real ID Massachusetts Driver's License

* You have a Real ID Massachusetts Driver's License marked "Limited Term"

* Your license photo is more than 14 years old or was taken before your 21st birthday

* You renewed online twice in a row

**Plan of Action:**

1. Complete your application [online](https://atlas-myrmv.massdot.state.ma.us/myrmv/_/). It will have a bar code that can be scanned to retrieve your information at the service center and save you time in line.

2. Supply your SSN or an updated Social Security Denial Notice (the notice is not more than 60 days old).

3. Provide documents to verify the following:Use [this guide](https://www.mass.gov/guides/massachusetts-identification-id-requirements#required-identification-documentation-overview-) to choose documents correctly.

   * Your lawful presence (1 document)

   * Massachusetts residency (2 documents)

4. Visit [an RMV service center](https://www.mass.gov/orgs/massachusetts-registry-of-motor-vehicles/locations) and bring the documentation above and your completed application.

5. Pass a vision test.

6. Pay the fee of $50.00. Most service centers accept cash, check, money order, and credit or debit cards. However, check what's accepted at the site you will be visiting.

7. Get a receipt that will work as a temporary license. Your new license will arrive within 7-10 business days.

Your new license will be valid for 5 years unless the duration of your lawful status in the US is shorter.
