## Renew Your Driver License in Michigan

### In Person

The Department of State sends a renewal notice about 45 days before expiration. You may renew your driver's license at a Secretary of State office up to 12 months before the expiration date. If your renewal notice states that your license is **not Real ID compliant**, you have to decide whether or not you want to apply for it. Check [here](https://www.michigan.gov/sos/0,4670,7-127-1627_81569---,00.html) if you need a Real ID-compliant license. If you decide to get a Real ID document, renew in person.

**Plan of Action:**
1. Visit a Secretary of State office. [Find a location](https://driving-tests.org/dmv-near-me/michigan-dmv-office-locations/) convenient for you. You may schedule an appointment or reserve your spot in line with MI-Time Line.
2. Provide documentation.
   - You must bring proof of the following to get your first Real ID license:
     - US citizenship or legal presence (passport or other [approved document](https://www.michigan.gov/documents/DE40_032001_20459_7.pdf))
     - Name-change documents (if applicable). Make sure you get your name updated with the Social Security Administration and wait 3 business days before visiting a Secretary of State office.
     - Social Security Number or letter of ineligibility (only if your renewal notice asks for it).

   If you renew a REAL ID license or want to receive a standard license, just bring your license or any other acceptable ID.
3. Pass the vision test. (Have your glasses on you if used for driving.)
4. Have your picture taken.
5. Pay the fee of $18.00 by cash, check, money order. Discover, MasterCard, and Visa are accepted, but a small fee is charged. Add a $7 late fee if renewing after the expiration date.

You will also need to renew in person if:
- Your Social Security number has not been verified by the Secretary of State office.
- Your name has changed.
- There is a change in your physical or mental condition.
- You renewed online or by mail last time.
- It has been more than four years since you last renewed in person.

Note that you must take a written and road skills test if your driver's license has been expired for at least four years.
