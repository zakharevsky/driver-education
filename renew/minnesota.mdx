## Replace or Renew Your Driver License in Minnesota

### In Person

Minnesota driver's license expires every four years on your birthday, unless it's a provisional license. You must renew it at any [Driver's License Office or Driver and Vehicle Services Exam Station](https://dps.mn.gov/divisions/dvs/locations/Pages/find-office-locations.aspx) before or on the expiration date if you want to keep your driving privileges.

**Plan of Action:**
1. Complete an application form at any driver's license office convenient to you.
2. Choose the type of license you need. You have three options: Standard, Enhanced, or REAL ID Compliant Driver's License. Check the options [here](https://dps.mn.gov/divisions/dvs/real-id/Pages/license-id-options.aspx).
3. Bring the following:
   - Your Minnesota driver's license (current or expired less than 5 years ago).
   - Your Social Security Number.
   - If your name has changed, bring a document that certifies the change, e.g., a certified marriage certificate.

   If you apply for a Real ID (recommended), use the [Interactive Pre-Apply for a Driverâ€™s License feature](https://dps.mn.gov/divisions/dvs/online-self-services/Pages/default.aspx) that helps you choose the correct documents for each type of license.
4. Pay the fee of $25.25 by check, money order, or cash (cards are not accepted).
5. Pass the vision test. Your normal or corrected vision must be at least 20/40, and your peripheral vision must be at least 105 degrees. If you fail vision screening, you will be asked to see an eye doctor.
6. Pass the knowledge test only if your license has been expired for more than a year. Free practice tests are available [here](https://driving-tests.org/minnesota/).
7. Have your picture taken. See [top 7 tips for an excellent driver's license photo](https://driving-tests.org/beginner-drivers/top-7-tips-excellent-drivers-license-photo/).

If you are turning 21, **do **not**** renew your license until **3 weeks before** your 21st birthday.

### By Mail

You can renew by mail only if you are currently out of Minnesota and your Minnesota driver's license is still valid.

**Plan of Action:**
1. Request the Out-Of-State Driver's License/ID Card Renewal Guide packet by phone (651) 297-3298 or email at [driverslicense@state.mn.us](mailto:driverslicense@state.mn.us). Include your full name, date of birth, and mailing address.
2. Receive your packet and complete it following the instruction sheet provided. Make sure you do the following:
   - Answer all the questions.
   - Sign your application and have it notarized (keep the yellow copy for your records).
   - Complete [the vision report](https://dps.mn.gov/divisions/dvs/forms-documents/Documents/DL_VisionReport.pdf) and have the vision examiner sign it.
   - Enclose check/money order for 25.25. Add another check for $20.00 if you want to get your license faster.
   - Mail your packet to DVS.
3. Receive your new license in about 6 weeks (2 weeks if expedited).

Note that DVS will use your old photo and signature already on record for your new license. As a result, you must visit a driver's license office within 30 days of your return to Minnesota to have a new photo taken.
