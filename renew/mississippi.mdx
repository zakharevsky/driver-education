## Replace or Renew Your Driver License in Mississippi

### In Person

You should renew your driver's license before it expires if you want to maintain driving privileges in Mississippi. The license can be renewed 6 months before and up to one year after the expiration date. The easiest way to renew in person is to use a Self-Service Renewal Kiosk. Find kiosk locations [here](https://www.dps.state.ms.us/driver-services/new-drivers-license/license-renewal-kiosk-locations/). You may use the kiosk if:

* You are between 17 and 75

* You have no unpaid tickets

* You can pay by credit/debit card

* You don't need to change your name or other information on your license.

* Your license is still valid or expired less than a year ago

* You are a US citizen

**How to renew at the kiosk:**

1. Swipe your expiring license or credit card.

2. Verify your information on the screen.

3. Take a new picture.

4. Pay the fee of 24.00 (for a 4-year license) or 47.00 (for an 8-year license). If your license has expired, pay the $1.00 late fee. You can pay by debit or credit card (Visa/MasterCard).

5. Get a receipt which will work as your temporary license. Your permanent license will arrive in the mail in about a week.

If you are not eligible to renew at a kiosk, visit [one of the driver license offices](http://www.driverservicebureau.dps.ms.gov/Drivers/Driver_License_Locations).
