## Replace or Renew Your Driver License in Missouri

### In Person

You may renew your license up to 6 months before it expires. The Department of Revenue will send you a reminder (Driver License Renewal Postcard). If your license expires, you mustn't drive until you renew it. You must visit a driver license office to renew your license. Use [this map](https://driving-tests.org/dmv-near-me/) to find a location near you. No appointments are available.

**Plan of Action:**
1. **Verify your social security number:** Provide it verbally. If you don't have one, present a letter from the Social Security Administration regarding the status of your social security number. Nonimmigrant foreign students, who are not authorized to work in the USA, don't have to bring this letter.
2. **Verify your residential address:** You can bring one document. Choose from the following:
   - Driver License Renewal Postcard
   - Pay check
   - Utility bill
   - Property tax receipt
   - Mortgage or house rental contract, etc.
3. **Verify name change (if applicable):** If you've changed your name, bring a document to verify it, e.g., a certified marriage certificate, divorce decree, etc.
4. **Pass the vision test.**
5. **Pass the road sign recognition test:** You must be able to tell what road signs mean.
6. **Pay the fee:** Your renewal notice will state the fee amount. It is 10.00 (under 21 or older than 70) or 20.00 (age 21-69). Pay by cash, personal check, cashier's check, money order, or card. Note that there is a convenience fee of 1.25 if you pay by card.
7. **Get a temporary license:** Your permanent license will be mailed to you in an unmarked envelope within 7 to 10 business days.

If you do not renew your license within 6 months (184 days) after its expiration date, you will be required to take the written and driving tests.

**Tip!** To avoid long lines, renew closer to the beginning of a month as license offices are usually busiest at the end of each month.

   - Proof of Military Active Duty or Dependent Status (e.g., military photo ID)
   - Last four digits of your SSN
   - Proof of Missouri residential address (e.g., voter registration card, utility bill, bank statement, government check stub, etc.)
3. Pay the fee of 20.00 by a U.S. cashier's check, money order, traveler's check, personal check, or credit card. Make checks payable to Missouri Department of Revenue. If you pay by card, complete the credit card information section within the application form.
