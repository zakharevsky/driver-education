## Replace or Renew Your Driver License in Montana

### In Person

You may renew your Montana driver license up to 6 months before it expires. If you don't renew before it expires, you lose your driving privileges at midnight on the expiration date. You will be able to drive again after your renewal is processed (no later than 3 months after the license expiration).

You must renew in person at [a driver license exam station](https://driving-tests.org/dmv-near-me/) if:

* You are a non-US citizen

* You renewed by mail or online during your last renewal

* You are younger than 21 or older than 67

* You need a name or address change

If you choose to apply at a rural limited-service driver license exam station, you must first pay for your license at the [county treasurer's office](https://dojmt.gov/driving/county-treasurer-motor-vehicle-offices/) and present the prepaid receipt to the driver examiner.

**Plan of Action:**

1. **Apply in person at a Montana driver license station:** You may schedule your appointment [online](https://dojmt.gov/driving/appointments/) or by calling (866)450-8034 during regular business hours. You may apply at any driver licensing station, use [this map](https://driving-tests.org/dmv-near-me/) to choose a station near you.

2. **Present your current Montana driver license:** If you do not have it on you, provide another [proof of identity](https://dojmt.gov/driving/required-docs/#proof-identity). If your name has changed, you must bring [proper documentation](https://dojmt.gov/driving/required-docs/#name-change) to prove the change.

3. **Pay the fee:** $41.72 for an 8-year driver license paid by check, cash, or credit card.

4. **Pass the vision test.**

5. **Receive your temporary license:** You may drive using your temporary license until your new license arrives in the mail within 2 to 4 weeks.

**If your license has been expired for more than 3 months**, you must reapply as a new driver and pass written, vision, and road tests.
