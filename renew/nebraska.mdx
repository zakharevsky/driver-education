## Renew Your Driver License in Nebraska

### In Person

Nebraska DMV sends renewal postcards 30 days before your license expiration. It is illegal to drive without a valid license, so plan your renewal in advance. You may apply for renewal 60 days prior to your 21st birthday; however, the license will not be valid until 10 days prior to your 21st birthday. If you are over 21, you may renew 90 days prior to the expiration date.

You may renew in person at any [Nebraska DMV driver licensing office](https://driving-tests.org/dmv-near-me/).
