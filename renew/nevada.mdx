## Renew Your Driver License in Nevada

### In Person

You must renew your driver license before it expires if you plan to keep driving. DMV will send you a renewal notice which states which methods of renewal you may use. Everyone may renew in person. If your license expiration date is coming and you haven't received your notice yet, you may [email DMV](http://dmvnv.com/contact_us.asp) your name, current address, and license number or call (775) 684-4560 or (877) 368-7828.

If you are planning an extended trip outside Nevada, note that you may renew your license as early as you wish.

**Plan of Action:**

1. [MAKE AN APPOINTMENT](http://dmvnv.com/dashpass.htm): Larger offices offer appointments. You may renew at any DMV office you want.

2. **Choose Real ID or Standard License:** If you want to be able to use your driver license while boarding a plane after October 2020, you will need to get a Real ID license (golden circle with a star in the corner). Read more about [Real ID](https://www.dhs.gov/real-id).

3. **Bring documentation required:** If you choose to get a Real ID license, bring the following:Check [here](http://www.dmvnv.com/dlresidency.htm) how to choose documents correctly.

   * Proof of identity

   * Proof of Social Security Number

   * Proof of address (2 documents)

4. **Complete your application form:** You may download it [here](http://www.dmvnv.com/pdfforms/dmv002en.pdf) or complete it at a DMV office.

5. **Pass the vision test and have your picture taken:** The minimum vision standard is 20/40 in one eye.

6. **Pay the fee:**

   * $42.25 (for an 8-year license).

   * $23.25 (for a 4-year or limited term license).

   * There is a $10 late fee if your license expired more than 31 days ago.

7. **Get your temporary license:** Your old license will be punched and given back to you together with your interim document. Your permanent license will be mailed to you.

If your license expired more than a year ago but less than four years ago, or you had three or more moving violations in the last 4 years, you will be asked to pass the knowledge test.

If the license expired more than four years ago, you will have to pass the knowledge and road skills tests.
