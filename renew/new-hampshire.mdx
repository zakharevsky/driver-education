## Renew Your Operator License in New Hampshire

### In Person

Most licenses are valid for 5 years and will expire on your birthday. It is illegal to drive with an expired license. The DMV office will send you a renewal notice 2 months before the expiration date, but you can renew without a notice up to 6 months before the license expiration date.

Note that you won't get a renewal notice if you moved and didn't [let the DMV know your new address](https://www.nh.gov/safety/divisions/dmv/driver-licensing/update-personal-information/address-change.htm) or your mail is forwarded.

**Plan of Action:**

1. **Apply in person at a DMV office:** You may choose [any DMV office](https://driving-tests.org/dmv-near-me/). No appointment is needed.

2. **Complete an application form:** You can download it [here](https://www.nh.gov/safety/divisions/dmv/forms/documents/dsmv450.pdf).

3. **Present your current NH driver's license:** If you [lost your license](https://driving-tests.org/beginner-drivers/what-to-do-if-you-lose-your-drivers-license/), show another proof of identity. If you are a non-US citizen, there are [more requested documents depending on your status](https://www.nh.gov/safety/divisions/dmv/driver-licensing/non-us-citizen/renew.htm).

4. **Bring documentation required for Real ID (optional):** If your expiring license is not Real ID compliant (doesn't have a yellow circle with a star in the corner), you may bring the documents below to get a Real ID license. Note that only this type of license will allow you to board the plane after October 1, 2020.Bring the following:

   * Proof of identity

   * Proof of Social Security Number

   * Proof of NH residency (2 documents)

5. **Pass the vision test:** It will measure how clearly you see. Wear your glasses or lenses if needed. You must be able to read the 20/40 vision line with both eyes.

6. **Pay the renewal fee:** $50.00 paid by cash, credit, money order, personal, or traveler's check.

7. **Have your picture taken:** See [top 7 tips for an excellent driver's license photo](https://driving-tests.org/beginner-drivers/top-7-tips-excellent-drivers-license-photo/).

8. **Get your temporary license:** It will be valid for 60 days. Your permanent license will be sent by mail within 60 days.

If your license expired **less than a year ago**, you may still renew it following the procedure above.

If your license expired **more than one year ago and less than 3 years ago**, you must bring all the documentation for the type of license you are renewing.

If your license expired more than 3 years ago, you will have to pass knowledge and road tests as well.
