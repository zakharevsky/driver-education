## Renew Your Driver License in New Jersey

### In Person

It is illegal to drive with an expired driver license in New Jersey. You may [renew](https://driving-tests.org/beginner-drivers/how-to-renew-your-driver%E2%80%99s-license/) up to 6 months before your license expiration date. The MVC will send you a renewal form by mail, but it is your responsibility to renew on time.

You may always renew in person, but you might also check if you are eligible to renew by mail and skip the trip to the MVC.

**Plan of Action:**

1. **Visit a motor vehicle agency:** Choose a licensing office using the map [here](https://driving-tests.org/dmv-near-me/). If you can, come in the middle of the day, avoid the end of the week and the end of the month, as this is the busiest time for the MVC agencies.

2. **Bring required documentation:**

   * **6 Points ID.** Use [the MVC Online Tool](https://www.state.nj.us/mvc/license/docselector/index.htm) to choose documents correctly.

   * Proof of address

3. **Complete the application form:** You will get it at a driver licensing office or bring the completed renewal form you got by mail.

4. **Pay the renewal fee:** $24.00 paid by card (American Express, MasterCard, Visa), check, money order, or cash.

5. **Have your picture and signature taken:** The MVC needs to capture your full face from the top of your forehead to the bottom of your chin. If you have a medical or religious need to wear a head covering in your photo, talk to the MVC staff at the agency camera station.

6. **Receive your driver license.**

Your renewed New Jersey basic driver license will be valid for another four years. It is a security-enhanced digital driver license with advanced facial recognition technology.

### By Mail

You may renew through mail if you are eligible to [skip the trip](https://www.state.nj.us/mvc/pdf/license/skip_the_trip_faq.pdf). Check the renewal notice sent to you. If you are eligible, you will get renewal materials with instructions.

You may not be eligible to skip the trip if:

* You have a Graduated Driver License (GDL).

* You have an active suspension.

* You have a Temporary Visa Restriction (TVR).

* You are required to have an ignition interlock device on your vehicle.

* The MVC needs a new photo to be taken in-person.

**Plan of Action:**

1. Complete the renewal form. Use blue or black ink.

2. Enclose the check or money order for the fee of $24.00.

3. Drop the form in the mail.

4. You will be mailed your new license within 10 business days.

5. If you have not received your license within 20 days of mailing, call the MVC at (609) 292-6500.

You may also renew by mail **if you are out-of-state for an extended period** and all of the following is true about you:

* Your current license is a New Jersey digital driver license and is about to expire or expired less than 3 years ago.

* You are a US citizen.

**How to renew your license if you are out of New Jersey:**

1. Write a letter explaining why you are unable to visit the MVC and when you plan to return to New Jersey.

2. Complete the application (BA208). Request it by contacting the MVC.

3. Enclose the check or money order for the fee of $24.00.

4. Enclose photocopies of [6 points of identification](https://www.state.nj.us/mvc/license/docselector/index.htm).

5. Add proof of permanent address in New Jersey.

6. Add your out-of-state/country address.

7. Provide a prepaid envelope to expedite the license delivery.

8. Send the packet to:
   NJ Motor Vehicle Commission Government In-House Unit 225 East State Street P.O. Box 016 Trenton, New Jersey 08666-0016

9. Your new license will be sent to the out-of-state/country address provided by you.
