## Renew Your New Mexico Driver License

### In Person

Your New Mexico driver license will be valid for 4 or 8 years. It is illegal to drive without a valid driver license, so you are required to renew it up to 90 days before or 30 days after its expiration date.

You may renew your license in person at any MVD field office. If your current license is not [a REAL ID](http://www.mvd.newmexico.gov/real-id-information.aspx) (doesn't have a yellow star in the top right-hand corner), you will have to bring extra documents to get a REAL ID driver license. Note that you won't be able to use another type of license to board a plane or enter federal facilities where ID is required after October 1, 2020.

**Plan of Action:**
1. **VISIT AN MVD FIELD OFFICE:** There are state-owned and privately-owned offices. Note that private offices require extra fees for their services. Find [an MVD office near you](https://driving-tests.org/dmv-near-me/). No appointment is needed.
2. **BRING REQUIRED DOCUMENTATION:** To get [a REAL ID](http://www.mvd.newmexico.gov/real-id-information.aspx), you must bring:
   - Proof of identity
   - Proof of identification number (SSN)
   - 2 proofs of NM residency

   Choose the documents with the help of [this list](http://www.mvd.newmexico.gov/realid-acceptable-docs7-25-18.pdf) to avoid another trip to the MVD.

   If you don't have enough documents to get a REAL ID, you may get a driver authorization card. To get it, bring:
   - Your current license
   - One more form of identity

   Documents not in English must be translated and the translation must be certified by the translator as full and complete.
3. **PAY THE LICENSE FEE:**
   - $18.00 for a 4-year license
   - $34.00 for an 8-year license
4. **SURRENDER YOUR CURRENT LICENSE:** It will be punched and returned to you with your temporary license which will be valid for 45 days.
5. **PASS REQUIRED TESTS (FOR EXPIRED LICENSES ONLY):** If your license expired more than a year ago, you will have to [pass the written test](#dmv-knowledge-test). If your license expired more than 5 years ago, you will also take the [road exam](#dmv-driving-test).

Your New Mexico driver license will be valid for another 4 or 8 years. It will be processed and sent to you by mail within 45 days. You may [check the status of your license online](https://eservices.mvd.newmexico.gov/eTapestry/_/#2).
