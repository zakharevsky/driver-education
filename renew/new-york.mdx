## Replace or Renew Your Driver License in New York

### In Person

You **must** renew your license in person at a DMV office in the following cases:

1. You want to convert to a Real ID or Enhanced (complete [this guide](https://process.dmv.ny.gov/ProofWizard/DisplayPages/pwizlicensePermitNDID.cfm) to make sure you have the proofs of identification needed for these types of licenses). If your current license was issued before October 30, 2017 and is not Enhanced, you have a Standard document. An Enhanced license will let you cross the Mexican and Canadian border without a passport provided that you are a US citizen. Both an Enhanced and REAL ID can be used to board a flight within the US and enter federal buildings. Standard license holders will need a second form of ID to board the plane after October 1, 2020. You can answer [these questions](https://dmv.ny.gov/which-id-right-me) to decide which type of document is more suitable for your needs.

2. You have a conditional or restricted license.

3. You have the words "Valid without photo" on your license.

4. You want to update your photo.

5. You participate in the ignition interlock device program.

6. You have 'Temporary visitor' on your license and the temporary visitor date expired (bring proof of an extension from the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS)).

**To renew in an office and keep your current document type, follow these steps:**

1. Complete the renewal notice (MV-2) that you received by mail. If you did not receive a notice, use [Application for Standard Permit, Driver License or Non-Driver ID Card](https://dmv.ny.gov/forms/mv44.pdf) (MV-44).

2. Bring your renewal notice or application and your current license to a DMV office, you don’t have to make an appointment; however, you may make [a reservation online](https://dmv.ny.gov/offices/make-reservation-visit-dmv-office) in New York City, Westchester, Nassau, Suffolk, Rockland, Onondaga or Albany Counties. To locate a nearby DMV office, use this [map](https://driving-tests.org/dmv-near-me/new-york-dmv-office-locations/).

3. Take a vision test at the DMV or bring a completed [Vision Test Report](https://dmv.ny.gov/forms/mv619.pdf)) (MV-619) or have your test sent to the DMV electronically by a [vision registry provider](https://dmv.ny.gov/node/145651).

4. Pay a fee by card, check, or money order. The fee is **64.50**, but if you are a resident of Bronx, Kings (Brooklyn), New York (Manhattan), Queens, Richmond (Staten Island), Dutchess, Nassau, Orange, Putnam, Rockland, Suffolk, or Westchester, you will have to add **16.00** for an 8-year license. Add an extra **30.00** to get an Enhanced license.

5. Get a temporary, non-photo license to use until your new license arrives in the mail (in about 10 business days).

**Tip!** You **must** renew your license before it expires, or you could face fines. You can renew your license up to 1 year before it expires. If you don’t renew the license 2 years after the expiration date, you will have to start the process of getting a new license as if you never had one.
