## Renew Your Driver License in North Carolina

### In Person

The DMV will send you a reminder card around 60 days before your license expiration date. You may renew your license in person up to 180 days before your license expiration date or within 2 years of your license expiration.

If you are not eligible to renew online, you must renew in person and pass vision and sign tests.

**Plan of Action:**
1. Stop by [any DMV office](https://driving-tests.org/dmv-near-me/) or schedule an appointment by calling (919) 715-7000.
2. **Bring required documentation:** If you want to get [a REAL ID](https://www.ncdot.gov/dmv/license-id/nc-real-id/Pages/default.aspx) (recommended) provide proof of the following:
   - Your identity and date of birth and legal presence (one document)
   - Your social security number (one document)
   - Your current NC address (2 documents)

   Check [this list](https://connect.ncdot.gov/business/DMV/REALIDToolkitDocuments/REAL%20ID%20Requirement%20List.pdf) to choose your documents correctly.

   If you want to get **a standard driver license**, you will need to present your current license.

   If your current has been lost or stolen, present 2 documents to verify your identity and a Social Security Card.
3. **Pass the sign recognition test:** You should be able to identify regulatory and warning signs by color and shape and explain what they mean.
4. **Pass the vision test:** You must meet vision standards for driving in North Carolina. Your license will show if you need corrective lenses.
5. **Pay the fee of $5.50 per year:** You may get the license for 5-8 years depending on your age.
6. **Get your temporary license:** Your permanent license will arrive in the mail within 20 days.
