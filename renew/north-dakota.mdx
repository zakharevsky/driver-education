## Replace or Renew Your Driver License in ND

### In Person

You may not drive if your driver license has expired. If you plan to drive after your license expired, you may renew it up to one year past its expiration date. If needed, you may renew it up to 10 months before the expiration date. You won't lose the time remaining on your old license.

You may renew in person at any time. Online appointments are available through [The Online Scheduler](https://www.ventusappointment.com/Booking/Booking/Index/5KIDD4bc). Appointments are not available for the same day.

#### Plan of Action

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1">
    Choose the driver's license site location:

    * Find an ND driver's license site near you using [this map](https://driving-tests.org/dmv-near-me/) and [book your appointment](https://www.ventusappointment.com/Booking/Booking/Index/5KIDD4bc).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 2">
    Bring the following:

    * Your booking confirmation number

    * Your current North Dakota driver's license

    * Your corrective lenses if you require them

    * Proof of address (only if it changed)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 3">
    Bring documentation to get a REAL ID compliant license (optional):

    * A REAL ID compliant driver's license will let you board the plane and enter federal buildings after October, 2020. (Other licenses won't grant you access.)

    If you wish your new license to be a REAL ID, bring proof of the following:

    * Identification

    * Social Security Number

    * ND residence address (2 documents)

    Check [this list](https://www.dot.nd.gov/divisions/driverslicense/real-id-information.htm#requireddocinfo) to choose the documents correctly.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 4">
    Pass the visual screen test:

    * It will measure how clearly you see. Wear your lenses if needed. You must be able to read the 20/40 vision line with both eyes.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 5">
    Have your picture taken:

    * Note that glasses are not allowed in the picture. See [top 7 tips for an excellent driver's license photo](https://driving-tests.org/beginner-drivers/top-7-tips-excellent-drivers-license-photo/).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 6">
    Pay the renewal fee:

    * $15.00 by cash or check. Dickinson, Minot, Bismarck, Williston, Devils Lake, Jamestown, Grand Forks, and Fargo also accept credit cards.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 7">
    Get your new ND driver's license.
  </Step>
</Steps>

If your license expired more than one year ago, you will have to retake both written and road tests.
