## Replace or Renew Your Driver License in Ohio

### In Person

It is illegal to drive with an expired driver license. If your license is about to expire or expired less than 6 months ago, you may renew it in person at any [deputy registrar license agency](https://www.bmv.ohio.gov/locations.aspx).

If you renew your license within 90 days of expiration, your new license will expire in 4 years. If you renew more than 90 days before expiration, your license will expire in 3 years. If you are turning 21, you cannot renew more than 30 days before your birthday.

**Plan of Action:**
1. **Apply at a deputy registrar license agency**: You don't need an appointment. Find [a deputy registrar office near you](https://www.bmv.ohio.gov/locations.aspx).
2. **Decide on the type of document**: You may choose to apply for a [Compliant or Standard](https://www.bmv.ohio.gov/NEWDL-ID/new-card-compare.aspx) license depending on your needs. Note that only a Compliant DL-ID meets national travel security requirements. You will need more documents to get a Compliant driver license.
3. **Bring required documentation**:
   - To get **a compliant driver license,** bring your current OH driver license and the proof of the following:
     - Your legal name and date of birth
     - Legal presence in the US
     - Social Security Number
     - Ohio street address (2 documents)
   
   Check [the virtual checklist of acceptable documents](https://www.bmv.ohio.gov/NEWDL-ID/acceptabledocs.aspx) and make a choice correctly.

   - If you choose to get **a standard license**, bring your current OH driver license.
   - If you need a name change, you must also provide proof of the change.
4. **Pay the fee**: $25.75 paid by credit card, cash, check, or money order.

Your new Ohio driver license will arrive by mail in about 10 days after the renewal. In most cases, it will be valid for 4 years. You may check the processing status of your license [here](https://services.dps.ohio.gov/BMVOnlineServices/Home/Login?returnUrl=%2FBMVOnlineServices%2FDL%2FIdentificationCard).

**If your driver license expired more than 6 months ago**, you must get a [temporary permit](#apply-learner-license) and pass knowledge, vision, and road tests.
