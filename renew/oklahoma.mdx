## Renew Your Driver License in Oklahoma

### In Person

Your OK Driver License will expire every 4 years. You may renew it up to one year before its expiration. If you are a US citizen or permanent resident, you may go straight to [a Tag agent](https://wa1.dps.state.ok.us/dls/motor_license_agents.php). If you are a resident alien, you will have to present your immigration documents to a [Driver License Examiner](https://driving-tests.org/dmv-near-me/) first.

If your license expired more than 3 years ago, you will be required to retake vision, written, and skills tests.

**Plan of Action:**
1. Visit [a Tag agent](https://wa1.dps.state.ok.us/dls/motor_license_agents.php). If your license expired more than a year ago, you will have to present a certified birth certificate. You may make an appointment [online](https://okdpsweb2.cxmflow.com/WebAppt/Wizard/AppointmentTypes?input=Service%20Name) to save time in line.
2. Provide one [primary](https://www.ok.gov/dps/documents/US%20Citizen%20Primary%20Proof%20of%20Identification.pdf) and one [secondary](https://www.ok.gov/dps/documents/Second%20Proof%20of%20Identity%20for%20any%20Person.pdf) identification document.
3. Have your picture taken. See [top 7 tips for an excellent driver's license photo](https://driving-tests.org/beginner-drivers/top-7-tips-excellent-drivers-license-photo/).
4. Pay the fees. In most cases, you will pay the license fee of 38.50. If you are older than 62, you will pay between 13.75 and 21.25. If you are older than 65, the renewal is free.
5. Receive your new license.
