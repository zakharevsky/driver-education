## Replace or Renew Your Class C Driver License in Oregon

### In Person

You may not drive if your driver license has expired. You may renew it up to one year before and past its expiration date. To [renew your license](https://driving-tests.org/driving-tests-for-drivers-license-renewal/), you will have to visit a DMV office.

**Plan of Action:**

1. **Complete the application form:** You may download it [here](https://www.oregon.gov/ODOT/Forms/DMV/173fill.pdf).

2. **Collect the following documentation:**&#x59;ou can learn more about acceptable documents [here](https://www.oregon.gov/ODOT/DMV/Pages/DriverID/IDProof.aspx).

   * One proof of identity (e.g., your Oregon driver license, certified birth certificate, US passport, permanent residence card, immigration documents, etc.)

   * One proof of your OR residence address (e.g., any document issued by an educational institution, pay stub, an item delivered by a postal service, etc.)

3. **Bring your application and documents to** [a DMV office](https://driving-tests.org/dmv-near-me/). Note that Mondays, Fridays, early mornings, late afternoons, and lunch times are usually very busy. You may [monitor wait times](https://dmv.odot.state.or.us/cf/waittime/index.cfm?action=all_office_wait_times) at some DMV offices.

4. **Pass a vision test** if you are 50 years of age or older.

5. **Have your picture taken.**

6. **Pay the renewal fee of $40.00:** You can pay by cash, checks, debit, and credit cards.

7. **Get an interim card:** Your new license will arrive in the mail.

If your driver license expired more than a year ago, you will have to take all the tests (vision, knowledge, and drive tests) and pay all the original fees.
