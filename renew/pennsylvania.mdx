## Replace or Renew Your Driver License in Pennsylvania

### In Person
Your Pennsylvania driver's license will be valid for 4 years, and you are expected to renew it if you want to keep driving. The license usually expires on the day after your birthday. Note that you will receive an Invitation to Renew (DL60A/DL60R) about 3 months before the expiration date. If you don't receive or lose the Invitation for Renew, you may [download Form DL-143](http://www.dot.state.pa.us/Public/DVSPubsForms/BDL/BDL%20Form/DL-143.pdf) and fill it in instead.

If you are 65 or older, you may renew your license every 2 years.

If you are not eligible to renew online, you may renew by mail.
