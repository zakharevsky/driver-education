## Replace or Renew Your Driver License in South Carolina

### In Person

Your South Carolina driver's license expires on your birthday every 8 years (10 years for REAL ID). The SCDMV will send a renewal notice about 60 days before your license expires.

You may renew in person at any [SCDMV branch office](https://driving-tests.org/dmv-near-me/south-carolina-dmv-office-locations/). No appointment is needed for most services.

**Plan of Action:**

1. **Visit an SCDMV office**: Find a location near you using [this map](https://driving-tests.org/dmv-near-me/).

5.    * Two proofs of SC residency
3. **Pass the vision test**: You must meet minimum vision standards.
4. **Pay the fee**: $25 for a standard license.
