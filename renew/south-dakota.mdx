## Renew Your Driver License in South Dakota

### In Person

Your South Dakota driver's license expires every 5 years on your birthday. The state does not send renewal reminders, so it's your responsibility to renew on time.

You may renew in person at any [driver license station](https://driving-tests.org/dmv-near-me/south-dakota-dmv-office-locations/).

**Plan of Action:**

1. **Visit a driver license station**: Find a location near you using [this map](https://driving-tests.org/dmv-near-me/).
2. **Bring required documentation**:
3.    * Your current driver's license
4.    * Proof of identity and legal presence
5.    * Proof of Social Security number
6.    * Two proofs of SD residency
3. **Pass the vision test**: You must meet minimum vision standards.
4. **Pay the fee**: $28 for a standard 5-year license.
5. **Receive your new license**: You will receive your license immediately at the station.
