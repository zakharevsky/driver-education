## Replace or Renew Your Driver License in Texas

### In Person

You must renew in person if you are not eligible to renew online, by mail, or by phone.

You can apply at any driver license office on a walk-in basis, however, some offices offer phone or [online scheduling](https://www.dps.texas.gov/administration/driver_licensing_control/rolodex/search.asp). To locate a nearby office, use this [map](https://driving-tests.org/dmv-near-me/texas-dmv-office-locations/).

**Plan of Action:**
1. **Complete the form**: If you wish, you can complete [the application form](http://www.dps.texas.gov/internetforms/Forms/DL-43.pdf) in advance or at a driver license office.
2. **Bring the following:**
   - Your current driver license
   - One document (primary or secondary) to [verify your identity](http://www.dps.texas.gov/DriverLicense/identificationrequirements.htm)
   - Your social security number
   - Documents to verify your [U.S. citizenship or lawful presence](http://www.dps.texas.gov/DriverLicense/LawfulStatusDLID.htm) if you haven't provided them before
   - The fee of 25.00 + 1.00 of administrative fee if you are between 18-84 years old. Age 85 and older pay 9.00 + $1.00 administrative fee.
3. **Pass the vision exam.**
4. **Provide your thumbprint.**

Your new license will be valid for 6 years (2 years for age 85 and older).

### By Mail

You can renew by mail **only if** DPS sent you an invitation to do so. To renew by mail, follow all the instructions on the form delivered to you.

If you are temporarily living outside of Texas (certain U.S. active duty military members, students whose parents live in Texas, etc.) but your permanent home is in Texas, you may renew or request a replacement of your Texas driver license by downloading the [Out-of-State or Out-of-Country packet](http://www.dps.texas.gov/internetforms/Forms/DL-16P.pdf).
