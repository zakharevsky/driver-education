Your vehicle's lights play a crucial role in safety, not only illuminating the road ahead but also communicating with other drivers. Ensuring they are fully operational is a key aspect of safe driving.

## Headlights

<Info>
Headlights are your primary source of visibility during night driving and are essential in poor weather conditions. They help you see and be seen by others.
</Info>

### Types of Headlights

- **Halogen**: The most common type, known for its yellowish light.
- **LED**: More energy-efficient, providing a brighter, whiter light.
- **HID (High-Intensity Discharge)**: Known for their bright, bluish-white light.

### When to Use

- **Nighttime**: Required after sunset.
- **Low Visibility**: Use in fog, rain, or snow for better visibility.
- **Dusk and Dawn**: Helps in transitional lighting conditions.

## Taillights and Brake Lights

<Tip title="Stay Visible">
Taillights are red lights at the rear, always lit when your headlights are on. Brake lights, which are brighter, activate when you press the brake pedal.
</Tip>

### Importance

- **Visibility**: Helps vehicles behind you see your car in low-light conditions.
- **Communication**: Brake lights warn drivers behind you when you're slowing down or stopping.

## Turn Signals

<Warning>
Turn signals (or indicators) are a must for safe lane changes and turns. Always use them to indicate your direction to other drivers.
</Warning>

### Effective Usage

- **Activate Early**: Signal at least 100 feet before a turn or lane change.
- **Check Functionality**: Regularly ensure all turn signals are working.

## Maintenance Tips

<Steps>
  <Step title="Regular Checks">
    Periodically check all lights—headlights, taillights, brake lights, and turn signals—to ensure they are functioning.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clean Lenses">
    Keep the lenses clean for maximum effectiveness.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Prompt Replacement">
    Replace any burnt-out bulbs promptly. Carrying spare bulbs can be handy.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Legal and Safety Considerations
Non-functional lights can lead to accidents and are often against the law. Ensure your lights are always operational to stay safe and compliant with traffic regulations.
