Your vehicle's lights play a crucial role in safety, not only illuminating the road ahead but also communicating with other drivers. Ensuring they are fully operational is a key aspect of safe driving.

## Headlights

Headlights are your primary source of visibility during night driving and are essential in poor weather conditions. They help you see and be seen by others. Learn more about [Driving Basics](/start-driving/driving-basics/understanding-your-car).

### Types of Headlights

- **Halogen**: The most common type, known for its yellowish light.
- **LED**: More energy-efficient, providing a brighter, whiter light.
- **HID (High-Intensity Discharge)**: Known for their bright, bluish-white light.

### When to Use

- **Nighttime**: Required after sunset.
- **Low Visibility**: Use in fog, rain, or snow for better visibility.
- **Dusk and Dawn**: Helps in transitional lighting conditions.

## Taillights and Brake Lights
**Stay Visible**

Taillights are red lights at the rear, always lit when your headlights are on. Brake lights, which are brighter, activate when you press the brake pedal. For more information, see [Car Maintenance](/car-care/routine-maintenance).

### Importance

- **Visibility**: Helps vehicles behind you see your car in low-light conditions.
- **Communication**: Brake lights warn drivers behind you when you're slowing down or stopping.

## Turn Signals
Turn signals (or indicators) are a must for safe lane changes and turns. Always use them to indicate your direction to other drivers.

### Effective Usage

- **Activate Early**: Signal at least 100 feet before a turn or lane change.
- **Check Functionality**: Regularly ensure all turn signals are working.
