# Reflecting Safety: Adjusting and Using Your Car Mirrors

Proper mirror adjustment is crucial for safe driving. Your car's mirrors – side mirrors and rearview mirror – provide a panoramic view of the environment around your vehicle, aiding in safe maneuvering and lane changes.

## Importance of Mirror Adjustment

<Info>
Correctly adjusted mirrors minimize blind spots and provide a wider field of view, reducing the risk of accidents during lane changes and other maneuvers.

## Adjusting Your Mirrors

<Steps>
  <Step title="Rearview Mirror">
    Position the rearview mirror to get the best possible view through the back window without having to move your head.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Side Mirrors">
    Adjust each side mirror outward so the rear corners of your car are just out of view, expanding your side and rear visibility.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Blind Spot Check">
    Even with properly adjusted mirrors, always perform a shoulder check to cover any remaining blind spots before changing lanes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Tips for Effective Mirror Use

Regularly glance at your mirrors to stay aware of your surroundings, especially before and during maneuvers like lane changes or turns.

### Dealing with Glare

- **Night Driving**: Use the night setting on your rearview mirror to reduce glare from headlights behind you.

Keep your mirrors clean and clear. Dirt, ice, or smudges can significantly impair visibility.
