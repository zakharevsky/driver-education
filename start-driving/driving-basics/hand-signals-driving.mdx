## When Should These Signals Be Waved? 
Hand signals aren’t always the go-to; modern vehicles are pretty good at communicating for us. But, there are a few instances where they become your best friends on the road: 
- **Lighting Issues**: When those blinkers or brake lights bow out, hand signals are your stopgap solution. Especially if you can’t fix the lights pronto. Remember, signal at least 100 feet before you turn – it’s not just courteous, it’s often the law. 
- **Motorcycle Moments**: In the world of motorcycles, especially in group rides or when your signal lights are on the fritz, hand signals keep the pack safe. Plus, engine braking doesn’t trigger the brake light, so your hand needs to do the talking. 
- **Bicycle Bound**: No built-in signals on your bicycle? No problem. Hand signals are crucial for sharing the road safely with other vehicles. 

Whether in a car, on a motorcycle, or pedaling a bicycle, hand signals are your silent allies in safe driving. They’re not just about passing your test or dodging tickets; they’re about making sure everyone on the road gets where they’re going without a hitch. So, give those hand signals a wave – they could be more powerful than you think!
